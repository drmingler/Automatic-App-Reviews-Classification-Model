# Automatic Classification of App Reviews using Transfer Learning
This project investigates the feasibility of using transfer learning to automatically classify app reviews into four categories: feature requests, bug reports, user experiences, and ratings. A novel approach is proposed that incorporates a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model with a transformer-based language model.

## Language Models Used
The following transformer-based language models are utilised in this study:

* BERT
* DISTILBERT
* ROBERTA
* XLNET

## Evaluation
The performance of each language model in a multi-class and multi-label text classification setting, as well as the ability of each model to generalise to a new dataset, is evaluated.

## Results
The numerical results in this work indicate that the ROBERTA language model and the multi-class text classification technique yield the best results when combined with the new transfer learning approach presented. Also, among all language models, BERT and DISTILBERT have the highest ability to generalise.
