I wanted an App that would separate my videos from my photo library.  I wanted to be able to play my photo slideshow without interruption from annoying videos.  The music stops and you have to start it over. Now the videos are on this app and I can play right through all my pictures.  Love it!,UE

Use Evernote all the time to keep track of my lifeawesome,RT
"I have used this App for over 8 months, and is by far, the best golf GPS for the money. I had a sky caddie before, and it was not half as good as this app. Don't waste your money on any of the annual dues GPS units, buy this app and have everything you need. 

I have the iPhone 4, and only uses about half the battery during a 4 1/2 to 5 1/2 hour round. Turn off your Wi-fi if it is using more battery life than that. 

Anyway, must have for all serious golfers.",RT

If never heard of Quizlet before, but by enabling the extended keyboard for pinyin, and my Simplified Chinese keyboard, I was easily able to make a custom list of words.  ? (shu?) on one side, and ""water"" on the other for instance.  Inputting them to this app was super easy!  Very well done and totally worth the $4.  Quizlet is free, by the way.",RT

"We really enjoy this app while traveling When you're on the road and you're ready to stop to eat, this is a great app to find a good place We have found some really good places to eat that we would not have known about Having a map to get you there also helps 

One small issue I have is that when you ask what's near you, or when you use a filter, not everything shows up  An example is that I was trying to find info on a brew pub near our motel  It didn't show up on the map and when I asked for pubs near my current location it didn't show up in the search  But, when I searched by name, there was the pub and reviews",PD

"...	Best app ever!

"When this app worked, I'd give it 4 stars But shortly after having it I got several errors about inability to sync And then I couldn't open all my notes And now it says trouble reaching evernote server Btw the solution to that 1 (after I tried reinstalling and rebooting) is to log in using user name instead of email (or vice versa Whatever you're having a problem w try the other) But annoying this happens at all 

If it works for you, this is a pretty good app to help you keep all those notes you scribble down and email yourself in 1 place",PD
This is the best video editor ever!!! I also like extras for iMovie but the only thing was that I wished I could cut out things people said that I didn't want. Other than that I love it!!!,FR

"I have over 200 notes in Evernote (verified in the Mac version and on Evernotecom), but only 4 of them appeared in the new version of this app until I deleted and reinstalled it Logging out and logging back in didn't work The new UI will take some getting used to but feels cleaner and faster than before",UE

"I was having problems with my Simple Machines forum crashing  while posting so I installed tapatalk. It freezes almost daily, but not before I finish a post. For that reason alone I keep using it. 

Unfortunately it limits my access to parts of the forum that are very useful to me. I cannot search the forum at all. I cannot see who started a thread, I cannot see auto signatures and I cannot use emoticons. Some of my browsing shortcuts are not available. Tapatalk offers nothing near the full browsing experience but it works and that's enough for now.",PD

"Evernote is an excellent and indispensable service in my life I'm happy to be a premium subscriber

The mobile app, however, seems to be getting progressively worse The latest version is clunky and buggy Not to mention that 'announcements,' which are essentially ads, now occupy the app's prime real estate If there were an extra-premium subscription that would let me hide those and focus on my work, I'd subscribe!

I love the document photo feature I use it daily In the latest app iteration, though, this feature causes a crash Arg!

I'm an Evernote evangelist, but I honestly could not recommend this mobile app

I started using trip advisor when my husband got a traveling job and I occasionally would go with him  Since then we have been addicted and I've hooked my parents on it too  Great for finding local gems in restaurants and decent hotels I love seeing the trip advisor signs when I go into restaurants now  Everyone can be a critic,UE

"Functionality is as advertised, but still buggy	I use DSLR controller via wifi on a 6D. During operation varying function such as aperture control, white balance, etc would cease to react irreproducably. Timed bulb exposure (being the only advantage over Canon's own app and the reason why I bought the app) causes the app and the camera (!) to crash. Disappointing and expensive. I keep hoping for more reliable updates.",FR
5 stars.,RT

"///Update///

149 rounds recorded. iPhone 3GS. Battery 70-80% left after rounds. Still no side game tracking but the notes feature works somewhat for that. Finally fivesomes! Sixsomes! THE BEST APP FOR GOLF!

17 rounds under my belt with this app now and still very happy. The new in-app stats (v.1.3) blew me away!  Still waiting for side games (skins, etc.). I'm confused why so many golfers leave their phone on the entire round? I pull mine out as I'm walking up to my ball, usually while I'm 20-30 yards away, I get positive satellite lock by the time I'm standing over the ball, read my yardage and put the phone back to sleep. After putting I whip it out, score the entire foursome (takes about 15 seconds total) and then put it back to sleep. I consistently have 80-85% battery life after my round is complete.

Once we get side games/betting included in a future update I will be even more of a cheerleader for this app!   
////////////////////\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
Used Golfshot for my last 6 rounds and I will continue to use it forever! It's accurate, easy to use, and being able to email your scorecard to your buddies and review actual stats for yourself are perks I didn't know I wanted, but now I can't live without!

Ended up being cheaper to buy a new iPhone 3GS AND this app than the skycaddie I was looking at. Stand alone golf GPS units are in serious trouble.",RT

"Can't get a response from Developers	The game itself isn't bad. If anything,  a bit monotonous.  However,  the manual is less than desirable,  specifically when speaking about how to feed cows. I figured out meadows on my own, but cant make straw bales for the life of me. And, this is apparently hkw to create manure flr fertilizer. I have emailed the developers, amd received no response. VERY FRUSTRATING! You spend money in the game for equipment that you can't use.",FR

"Pretty good!	I've edited many photos using this application already. Something to probably address is the photo not always saving what you're looking at in the preview. The beautify tool is a good example of this, as it may look fine in preview, but when you save it, you don't exactly get the same quality. Sometimes it turns out a little pixalated, but overall a remarkable app! I use this in conjunction with other apps.

I have only started using this app after having it on my device for over 3 weeks. I was influenced to use it when a saw a colleague use hers with glee.

"I've always found Dropbox a bit buggy, but it's gotten worse since I updated to IOS 7  When I download zip files or webpages &amp open the files, the screen is blank, blackened or a blurred enlarged image of the symbol (of Facebook, Google or other symbols related to the site that the the zip file or webpages it came from 

As a teacher, I rely on having access online &amp off line related to research  for work my work as a teacher  Also, I am required to write notes &amp save them as zip files in order to save space

So, please fix Dropbox! Why does it keep telling me that I can't open some documents &amp that I don't have the authorization to alter or edit my document on the flip side, some documents tell me to enter a password (???)

If anyone has any suggestions to improve this or recommends a different program to recommend, I would appreciate it

"Waited for this update, then we get this? EverNote is no longer for taking text notes It is now obvious to me, and I have been in denial for over a year 

There is no font control, editing is random and buggy, slow as molasses, and unreliable-- when you take time to write a paragraph, you want 100% confidence EverNote will not crash midway, or you get Synchronization Fail and thus lose your work 

Note sorting and text-friendly organization (ie, lists) have been thrown out the window for a shiny interface and lots of icons and flashy graphics I can't write with the confidence that EverNote will not crash, but HEY, I can take a picture of my pancakes and keep it for posterity Hey, EverFail, I quit I am canceling my membership today

Now that I have this app I can't imagine how I got anywhere without it. In my experience it's approx 98% accurate and the spoken directions are a necessity when you're driving alone. One improvement would be to have the spoken directions a little earlier especially on a busy highway. I'd recommend this app to anyone looking for reliable accurate directions.,FR

"I have been using this product for 5 days and I love it.  If you are seeking for an app mainly to write school paper, do basic spreadsheet, and reading PDF articles, this is the one.  Of course, you can't compare to iWork apps because they will definitely beat this app in terms of looks and quality (called great marketing).  But if you are a poor student like me, paying student loans, and are seeking for an app mainly to write papers and read docs, I recommend with this one. I have not tried the PowerPoint yet, so I can't say much about it.",RT

"You're probably thinking why pay when you can get something similar for free...I thought the same thing and finally ponied up (do you really spend *that* much more/less on a cup of coffee?) and the value it's added on a daily basis is invaluable. Time tables are pretty accurate, but what I love are the service advisories that constantly change every weekend and the neighborhoods maps, not to mention the last minute emergencies on lines due to a water main break or police incident or what have you. Better to plan your trip to avoid a certain line rather than find out at the station when yellow tape is blocking your way, and you have to walk a half mile to catch another line and find out the same thing before saying SOD it and catching a cab. Has saved me so much in time.",RT

"Locations on maps are incredibly inaccurate Sometimes it's only a few blocks wrong, or maybe a mislabeled street, but I am seeing much worse locations outside of San Miguel de Allende are shown within the downtown area Want to golf? Go horseback riding? Come to the historic Centro, where it is mapped but doesn't exist The most funny in accuracy is the pyramid supposedly a few blocks from my rental house

Next problem, related to this is the 'Near Me' function First, the app couldn't find me Instead, it thought I was in a town two hours away and showed me attractions for that town When I dragged the map to the town I am in there was more of the map craziness, but even worse The few locations that were accurately mapped now shifted to within a block or two from my house

Lastly, the new version is less functional than the previous version And it's a lot less functional than the website

Bottom line is that I am deleting until at least the map issues get fixed I am definitely unhappy with this version",PD

I adjust the GPS settings to extend battery life and I can go on epic rides and still have power to text my buddies photos from the trail. I highly recommend it for on the fly trail mapping needs.

"This is a finely crafted bubble shooter with great graphics, cute characters, and fun gameplay that merits 4 or 5 stars.

HOWEVER, that is all cancelled out by trying to make you pay real money in order to keep playing. I believe it's 5 turns a day you get for free, so if you lose 5 times you have to either wait a specific amount of time or pay money to keep playing. 

This breaks up the gameplay because I refuse to make in-game payments of this sort. I HATE this type of payment system. I would much rather buy the game up-front for $1, $2, or even $3. If that option becomes available, I would definitely buy this game.",RT

"Seems like the Evernote religion has passed me by Perhaps there are handy tools that I am missing trainings that are obvious to all but me But, really! The notes, bullet points, spacing, numbering all fail when i transfer to Word and other systems The resulting formatting problems take longer than just starting over and retyping notes I also find that the left column flickers and the program crashes at every other use About 1 in 4 syncs give an error message 

All that aside, I like calling up notes on my phone, ipad, and desktop (almost) whenever I want If this problematic version is intended to induce me to go for another version, it doesn't In fact, if this version were more solid, I'd be tempted to buy the upgrade",PD

"This is not a review of the Dropbox service (which is great) but of this app, which can use a lot of improvements The single most frustrating thing about it is that it displays only a dozen or so characters in a file name Since I have thousands of files, some with long and descriptive names, it is impossible to find what I'm looking for unless I download the files to the iPad one by one There is no way to resize the file list to make more of the files visible Why not?",PD
Perfect &lt3	I love this app so much so simple to use I adore it &lt3,RT

"I love Evernote and frankly don't know how I'd live without it I have it installed on my desktop, iPhone and iPad  It's a lifesaver For newbies you might not be sure how to use this app Head to their website and they have user guides which will give you some ideas Once you incorporate it you'll start seeing the value right away",RT
Sometime in the last month Dropbox stopped syncing The most recent files on my phone are all 1 month old yet there are many more current files that I have loaded in Dropbox desktop folder for syncing Help!,PD
It's an amazing app and I love it's features except for one little problem The GPS feature is a bit off I'm at home and when I want to make a quick note it gives me the wrong address It would be great if this could get fixed,PD
Great in every way !,RT
"Great for Instagram	I love this app! It is soooo great for making your pics look cool The fx, editing, collage Everything is just so handy",UE

Great app to keep track of hours. Especially if you're on salary or budgeting.,RT
Great app. Use it all the time.,RT

Very useful App for travelers I highly recommend it!,RT
Perfect!!!!,RT
"A well engineered multipurpose calculator.  If the extensive template library doesn't have what you need you can easily create your own calculators without a steep learning curve. As a repeat customer since the Palm handheld days, I definitely consider this a great value.  Keep up the good work!",UE
This is a great app for a family on a bujet,UE
"My iPad air and iPhone 4 on iOS 7 still will not open any pages documents, all they show is the document name and size",PD
Very fun!!! Love it!!!,RT
YES	Best app since sliced bread,RT
Im a rap artist because if this,RT
Love this	Ths the bst app,UE
"Awesome	I love pinterest its a place where I can keep all the things I like and are interested in, in one place",RT
"Works great! Maps are good, better than my Garmin. Default is the lowest cache amount so make sure you turn up the cache amount so you don't find yourself without any maps when you lose service. Make sure you scout your area with the maps you want before hunting so it will cache your map area for when you lose service you still can use your cached maps. Best 5 bucks spent for those who want a good hunting GPS.",RT
HTC one	Best social app ever!!  (Y),RT
Good but sad	Good game overall but couldnt open game so reinstalled and lost progress. Also i bought coins and lost those also. Other than that a great game,FR
One of my favourite if not the favourite social networking sites	Use it every day to find and store lots of interesting and lovely things,RT
"I like the UI improvements with the new version The old UI was hideous and I usually used En via another app like drafts or IFTTT 

But the fact that I cannot add recent photos from my album!?!?!!? This is the main function for me of Evernote This must be fixed!",UE
Love this site it nails every question I have ever asked.very helpful and resourceful.once I found i could download this app for my phone it made it so much more convienant for us.my family goes by it and we love it!,RT
"I am totally addicted to this, this is my only app that I have from so long ago only one tiny problem it does freeze but only once in a blue moon so it doesnt really bother me #1 best app I am up to level 101 NO JOKE!!!!!!!",PD
"Nice design refresh Looks great 

I love this app Dropbox totally saved me at work I had to email a bunch of large files and the work email system wouldn't take it 

Dropbox worked flawlessly Not only did they get links to download the files, but they could also view content right in their web browser PDFs, Word docs, and videos all were viewable in the browser for them It made presentations a breeze! 

I now use Dropbox for personal use too Love it",UE
A very fun and easy way to keep up with your heart rate...also quite accurate!!!,UE
good app	consumes more amount of phone  memory,UE
"I am extremely excited about the possibilities for tracking my prospects and clients in a user friendly manner with evernotes  The Tag and Search functions make it easy to recall prospects who are interested in specific models --- new and used  I can order the searches to look at latest entries first which is very important in my business  Many other applications work well, but I do have one observation that you should be aware of  There seems to be a bug in the search function for notebooks, when you do a search in a specific notebook  The all notebooks search works fine, as does the tag search breakdown  All in all, this is a great program",UE
Sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo	Nice supper photo editing wow,RT
I was very pleased with this app.  The graphics are excellent and the interface is very easy to use and navigate through.  The quiz options and video are a great bonus feature.  I am really satisfied (especially for the price) and look forward to trying out the other systems' software.  Nice Work!,RT
Intrsting app,RT

"This may sound like a broken record, but I really like your app when it can download. But it can't now. I hate having to type this, but this needs to be fixed.",PD
"Im on an original iPad mini and so maybe that's part of he deal but it seems like there are still little thins that need some work For example the spell check doesn't work just right and the search is slow at times Neither of these or any others will keep from giving this app a great rating 

I also think that here are improvements I hope to see in the future One is full screen mode Maybe I'm missing this but the only time you get full screen is when you start a new note I'd like this options when reading or editing too 

Keep up the good work!",FR
Nice	Ossam,RT
many many things to njoy with your photos! ^~^ Thanks!!,RT
"Every time I try to go on this app it crashes and sends me back the my home page. I have to keep trying and trying to get on. Other than the crashing this is a great app, and I'll give it 5 stars once the crashing problem is fixed.",RT
I love it	Easy to use,RT
"Love, love, love Pinterest!",RT
I love the app but it's annoying cause when I use the premade hats they come half out with the middle half of the hat gone so I can't make what I want easily.,RT
"It is what it says it is, which is refreshing A place to collect all the pieces of information that can clutter your life Sure, it takes some work on your part to sort it all out but you have to get it in one place first That is what Evernote does best It's on my iPhone, iPad and MacBook I use it everyday",UE
This app is great for road trips. The kids can listen to their music and I can put on headphones and listen to my books.,RT
Excellent	I am iy touch with my childhood friends,RT
The app is probably the best music app  on the app store.,RT
Ran side by side with other and this app beat all hands down. Needs dedicated space for mileage.,RT
"I use this app traveling through six countries in Europe over a period of three weeks and it was flawless. The off-line option always worked great.
Do not expect this map to give you distances from place to place it will not do that. But once you get into a city if you want to get around, this cannot be beat.",PD
"Thank you, thank you! It's fixed!	I LOVE Pinterest over all other  apps! I now know how it feels to be addicted to something, but I get a great deal of enjoyment from it! It's the most simple way to collect & organize interests, and new ideas It is an almost too good to be true awsome app! The only draw-back I see is when I'm using pinterest, time goes by sooo fast I recommend this app & tell people who are looking for  a certain pattern, I have that exact pattern on Pinterest!",UE
Good	Others have to try,RT
I've been depending on Evernote for years The mobile app makes it even more convenient,RT
Nice!,RT
Picsart	Awesome photo editor,UE
Goodgood,RT
"Decent app. Finally, notifications are here. Now please give us multi account login, Google.",FR
"Used to be a good application with ability to search cities you haven't yet reached and filter by rating as well as proximity however those features have been replaced with functionality focused on marketing hotels

Don't use this application purchase a good guidebook instead",PD
"Startup fixed, not bad.	Seems like they fixed the startup issue.",RT
My 4 yr old can't get enough!,RT
"Update, EN performance has improved considerably (from 2 to 3 stars) since my last review, however the app remains pretty buggy It constantly reports failure to synch, it freezes momentarily between all actions, it crashes here and thee, and the search function sometimes fails to find key words I am borderline thinking of going premium, but also keeping an eye for alternatives Note, some of my problems may be related with some incompatibility of iPad2 with iOS7

Previous review,
After several months of daily use, and building about 1K pretty intensive notes, I was in the process to put a serious long-term commitment to EN- but I've had to seriously rethink this after the problems with the last upgrade The problems I've experienced are not as severe as what others are reporting Mine have been mostly with the iPad 2 version, while the desktop version w MacBook Air has continued to work OK 

On the iPad things have actually improved quite a bit over the past week, in terms of less freezes, when trying to do a search- so for me it is wait and see, to see if EN can get it together The searches have also become less efficient and clunky in all iPad &amp Mac desktop versions I am still working on EN, but will also be on stand-by, and looking for possible alternatives

I don't have many concerns w the new design, as others do-- but I do hope that EN programmers can stay focused on the real issues",PD
"Older versions of this app used to allow me to preview word, excel and pdf documents While the preview pane is still there the app just tells me the file name and size and does NOT display the content Completely useless",PD
Neat app,RT
Awesome	Simply superb  good wok,RT
"Please read the instructions to make sure your school is on the list for this app.  It seems like everyone who marked this app poorly because they couldn't log in, didn't bother to read the instructions!!!! It clearly states your school's system must be enabled for this app to work.",RT
This is one of my very FAVORITE apps. I tell everyone I know about it. If you are a music lover you'll love it. I really like that it even gives the lyrics to the song & shows other songs/ music by the same musician(s). Our children love it too. It's great. Thank you,UE
Nice	Nice aplikasi,RT
"Having fun. I never had much interest in astronomy, but this app has changed everything.",UE
Excellent app	Does everything I would expect in a mail app,RT
"It is impossible to refine a hotel search for specific criteria beyond location, price and quality Those are well done and quality reviews and coverage are the reasons we use TA Especially during peak seasonal flows, many of us travel with pets We have a terrible time finding clean, reliable hotels Most sites for pet travel are woefully inadequate How hard would it be to include this as an additional search filter? That would bring in helpful reviews that would not only enhance the site experience but also improve the field",FR
Kiran	Best photo editor app,RT
Nice app	Good,RT
Very nice radar app. Easy to use,RT
Can't easily share composition due to file type.,PD
This is an app that is relevant to everything I do I use it everyday! My top 5!,RT
Best	I am always on whatsapp My only means of talking Its good Better than normal texting,RT
"First off, let me say that it looks great...if I could get it to stay up for more than 5 seconds...then it CRASHES!  The concept is wonderful and the app appears to be very nicely done from a user interface standpoint but it is very unstable.  Big disappointment since I use this for my doctoral studies, major failure in the mobility and convenience categories...0 out of 10 for usefulness.",PD
Probably the most important app I use,RT
Rahul	Good,RT
"When I put things into my dropbox folder on my desktop, I can find files by date modified, by name, etc  The app has an incomprehensible and un-modifyable sorting function  It's almost impossible to find files within the app  Once you find them on your phone, I believe you can 'favorite' them  But the challenge is to find them",FR
Its cool	Its awesome,RT
Outstanding  Would be nice to have the PC app features available in IOS app,RT
"No matter where I travel, it's very accurate to use.",UE
Absolutely handy for those pics you don't need everyone else to see.,RT

Still no ability to change file names - a very basic function Hard to believe after this amount of time Error messages when simply trying to move files No response from dropbox,FR
Yes	Top,RT
New update doesn't detail what's changed Now the app doesn't work Just a black screen with a gray bar at the bottom Please fix soon,PD
"Great app.  No bugs.  Thoughtful, provoking news.",RT
"I use this app almost every weekend while exploring back roads and trails by motorcycle. Functionality is excellent while on the road as well as using the data to review later using Google Earth. 

I've tried all the GPS tracking apps and this is the one I go back to every time. 

I strongly recommend reading the users guide and watching the videos. 10 minutes spent learning the app will really pay off in how much use and function you get out of the app.",UE
The interface works great and mapping is nice :) Only bug I've seen is Facebook integration at times.,PD
"Can't open the apps	Whenever I open the apps it shut down after few seconds. I tried uninstall and reinstall, and its the same. It was ok before the last update.",FR
It works perfect for me.,RT
Love traveling!!,RT
"Absolutely a must have for planning a trip! You have access to restaurants, attractions, and hotels with reviews!",UE
"This app is good, but very confusing and hard to navigate at first. The review sheet doesn't make any sense, but good app, overall",RT
Great app to have for tracking flights! I own a limousine company & all my drivers use it to track their clients flights.,RT
Ok	OK,RT
Excellent	The best,RT

"LG Spirit	many bugs sometimes it wont shoot a picture and i have to reopen app, orientation when I rotate phone works about 20% of the time, touch to focus is terrible, focus in general is terrible no matter what setting and other things as well. HD CAMERA PRO takes MUCH better pictures and its free. Quit adding so many features...who cares what frame i put on a blurry picture?",FR
Provides for hours of uproarious entertainment!,RT
I was shocked to find the app includes overhead clearances and one can filter that down to what they are worried about.  Looks to be very thorough.  I have not yet tried it on the road but I am amazed at what I can find by sitting her in my house.  I am a little concerned about how much functionality I will find in remote locations with no cell service.  Time will tell.  I may have to update my rating when that situation arises which will be in 4 weeks.  Happy camping everyone!,RT

"Does everything I would need a simple weather app to do. Radar is slow to load, but I have another app for that. There's not a lot of detail in the information, particularly in details for upcoming days. The forecast is no more specific than a high and low temp and a picture representation of the weather for the entire day. Nevertheless, this isn't meant to be too detailed, and it provides plenty of info for the current time. My biggest complaint is that the app crashes on startup often. Sometimes it will load the second time, sometimes it requires a restart of my iPad 3rd generation. It's a nice looking app, the kind that you would want to have on your iPad, it just has a stability problem.",PD

"I was happy to see this app however it doesn't work and caused all sorts or network configuration problems. I called hp to reset printer, iPad, and computer and even they couldn't figure out what the problem was. After a ton of lost time I decided to erase the app and it allowed the iPad to find the printer using AirPrint again.

"///Update///

149 rounds recorded. iPhone 3GS. Battery 70-80% left after rounds. Still no side game tracking but the notes feature works somewhat for that. Finally fivesomes! Sixsomes! THE BEST APP FOR GOLF!

17 rounds under my belt with this app now and still very happy. The new in-app stats (v.1.3) blew me away!  Still waiting for side games (skins, etc.). I'm confused why so many golfers leave their phone on the entire round? I pull mine out as I'm walking up to my ball, usually while I'm 20-30 yards away, I get positive satellite lock by the time I'm standing over the ball, read my yardage and put the phone back to sleep. After putting I whip it out, score the entire foursome (takes about 15 seconds total) and then put it back to sleep. I consistently have 80-85% battery life after my round is complete.

Once we get side games/betting included in a future update I will be even more of a cheerleader for this app!   
////////////////////\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
Used Golfshot for my last 6 rounds and I will continue to use it forever! It's accurate, easy to use, and being able to email your scorecard to your buddies and review actual stats for yourself are perks I didn't know I wanted, but now I can't live without!

Ended up being cheaper to buy a new iPhone 3GS AND this app than the skycaddie I was looking at. Stand alone golf GPS units are in serious trouble.",UE

"I've been using Evernote since 2005 when I was in college It's a wonderful service and up until the iOS7 redesign the apps have always worked great 

But the design of this app is terrible  It's jumbled, confusing and lots of advertising for their service add ons and 'news' get in the way of core functionality 

Please redesign the app  Again",UE

"The one good thing about the last update ws the ability to make folders. But, you are not able to make folders inside folders. I wish you could. The bad things about the last update? Now typing has lag which is very annoying. I don't see how that happened since there is no crazy graphical interface or anything animated. The major thing that is pretty much a deal breaker for most people is the removal of the TAB button. I always hated that the TAB button was up on the ruler. I would prefer having only one shift key and place the TAB on the keyboard. But now i wish it was back up top at least. Now you have to go through a complicated process and menu to use it. I've stopped using Pages now since it is such a pain to tab unless you are using a bluetooth keyboard.",PD

the latest update fixed the issue of crashes and also can view the pdfs without problem thanks a lot for your work!  however there is still a problem which is that when you try using the 'open in' option in other iPad applications, and ask to open in Dropbox, the filed just opened shows up in the iPad Dropbox application, but the Dropbox server is not updated meaning that file is not found in the Dropbox folders if you access the folders in a different devicecomputer, etc",PD

There is an option to add it to your calendar and it puts all the information right in your phone calendar. You can invite your co-diners easily through the app (it creates an email for you). A great part is that you can filter your search by 1000 point tables only, by neighborhoods within a city, by distance to you, and so much more. I use this app on a regular basis- so much that I'll make a reservation we just decided to go to so that it's easier when we get there! It's such a great app (and business) that I always wonder why some restaurants don't have it!",RT

Overall a great app.  I use it daily. It would be helpful if entrance and communion antiphons were included. I do not appreciate the new  in app purchase feature.  The saint of the day should either be included with the program or have a way to remove the buy button for those who do not want to purchase this.,FR

It's as accurate as any weather forecaster who gets paid good money for often being 100% wrong. So far this app has been close enough to allow me to dress appropriately so who cares about too much scientific input. I just don't want to be carrying an umbrella when the sun is shining.,RT

"The one good thing about the last update ws the ability to make folders. But, you are not able to make folders inside folders. I wish you could. The bad things about the last update? Now typing has lag which is very annoying. I don't see how that happened since there is no crazy graphical interface or anything animated. The major thing that is pretty much a deal breaker for most people is the removal of the TAB button. I always hated that the TAB button was up on the ruler. I would prefer having only one shift key and place the TAB on the keyboard. But now i wish it was back up top at least. Now you have to go through a complicated process and menu to use it. I've stopped using Pages now since it is such a pain to tab unless you are using a bluetooth keyboard.",FR
"I'm giving the NFL '12 v3 update three stars largely because it's an improvement over the previous version. The in-game display is better organized, and the ""Scores"" page is vastly superior to the prior version: you can now see all games for the current week on one screen instead of scrolling through a list. After a modest amount of use, the app appears much more stable.

However, it still needs work in many respects. The scoring summary is gone (so far as I can tell); I often found this helpful when checking up on games that I wasn't following play-by-play. The ""team leaders"" appears limited to only 1 QB (passing), 1 player rushing, and 2 receivers, with no apparent way to scroll through players or pull up a full listing. Especially during the preseason games, when teams are running through multiple personnel packages, this is very frustrating--there's no way (for example) to compare the passing stats of the 2 or 3 QBs who have gotten playing time. A more egregious problem is that (at least for the Thursday games in week 2), the teams do not switch properly: checking on the Atlanta vs. Cincinnati game, if I tap on the ""Atlanta Falcons"" button, I get the passing stats for A. Dalton; if i tap on the ""Cincinnati"" button I see the passing stats for M. Ryan (with the rushing and receiving stats for their teams). I'm hoping this is an operator error that will be fixed shortly, but it reflects poorly on the product. (I apologize for the comments length, I'm hoping that the NFL is monitoring this feedback.)",PD

"I gotta say, overall I like this app, although the logic behind the 15 min cap on streaming alludes me I thought they may have imposed it to reduce bandwidth, but with the limit it actually increases bandwidth The reason is because I start downloading the whole file, then start streaming it Once the 15 min is up, I then switch to the downloaded file To me, this uses more data Why can't I just stream the whole thing? Overall, though, I like everything else about this app",UE

There is an option to add it to your calendar and it puts all the information right in your phone calendar. You can invite your co-diners easily through the app (it creates an email for you). A great part is that you can filter your search by 1000 point tables only, by neighborhoods within a city, by distance to you, and so much more. I use this app on a regular basis- so much that I'll make a reservation we just decided to go to so that it's easier when we get there!

Every single time I open up the App, it defaults to the 'Updated' view of all my notes Then, when I select either 'Title', which is how I REALLY WANT to organize my notes, in alphabetical order, or I select 'Created,', the App immediately crashes and closes  I have tried this over 50 times! I tried rebooting my iPadno to avail  I tried deleting the App all together, and then reloaded it, but still the same problem!  This HAS TO BE FIXED ASAP PLEASE!!!!!!!  I can't effectively use my notesit's too much of a hassle to try to look in each month for a note created, and even each month is not in alphabetical order  THERE IS NO RYTHME OR REASON TO THIS UPDATE!!!!  I have always been one of your biggest advocates and proponents  If this bug isn't fixed pronto, I will have to delete Evernote permanently, and use a different App!  ARGHHHHHH!!!!!!",RT

Simple enough to use and I love the recurring transactions. No more forgetting and figuring out how to balance my checkbook every month. The other reason I got the app is because it can export to Quickbooks although I have not used that feature yet. The reports are great.

Now that I have this app I can't imagine how I got anywhere without it. In my experience it's approx 98% accurate and the spoken directions are a necessity when you're driving alone.

"Out of a dozen attempts I made on my iPhone 4, I was able to get it to work three times. And even then it was frustratingly inconsistent in recognizing a pulse. I'm not sure what the indication is that it's reading your heart rate, as the ""dial"" moves around and then restarts constantly. Sometimes a blinking heart shows up. The instructions don't explain what the dial and heart icon are for. Keeping my finger in the same location would reveal a heart rate of 85... and then 31.

Watched the video on their website to look at the location of my finger in comparison to theirs--same spot. It's possible that the technique they use to measure the heart rate doesn't work on everyone--thus the vast disparity in ratings for the app. Seems to work for some people and not for others.

Doesn't work at all on my iPad 2 even in good lighting.",RT

"Clear has one of the best-designed user interfaces I've ever encountered on the iPhone/iPad. It is the way apps should be. So simple and easy. I'm giving it 5 stars despite some shortcomings:

1. It would be nice to sync with the desktop (iCal?) and between devices.
2. It needs Reminders and Alerts (and Due Dates, etc.)
3. Some kind of support for longer notes. Right now, single-tapping an item lets you edit the item. Maybe double-tapping should let you open an item's ""detail page"" where you could enter the due date, add an alarm, or type a longer note. 
4. Also, sharing a list? It would be great if my wife and I could add to or just see each other's shopping lists. Though now, I admit this is ""feature creep"" that could detract from Clear's simplicity.",FR

Sometimes the files will open for a few seconds and then a gray screen comes up Most of the time I just get the gray screen  The gray screen has the file name, 'Office Open XML Spreadsheet'' and the file size

My spreadsheets are simple (no macros) and small in size  I've tried creating new spreadsheets and have the same issue  Web research shows others have same issue but no fixes have worked for me 

I'm on the latest IOS 704 and the most recent version of Dropbox 301

Chat with Apple Support says it is a DropBox issue",PD
"Overall fantastic.

The UI is a little clunky, and things like tapping in the golf ball icon to measure club distance were a little tough to find. It doesn't look like a button.

Wish I could view the clubs and look at their performance without starting a round.

Statistics could use some work as well. The charts while fairly easy to read seem disjointed. 

Needs a better social aspect.",RT

Simple enough to use and I love the recurring transactions. No more forgetting and figuring out how to balance my checkbook every month. The other reason I got the app is because it can export to Quickbooks although I have not used that feature yet. The reports are great. Would love to be able to have main categories and sub-categories. That's the only thing missing in my opinion to make this a truly robust stand-alone financial management app. Keep up the good work!,UE

"Well, I like it. That's right.",UE
"I've been using this for just over 6 weeks and have eliminated all paper notes. Even when I'm in a meeting without a laptop or iPad, my paper notes can be easily loaded by simply snapping a photo. In addition, classifying a note by notebook and adding tags makes it easy to spread them over a few different dimensions so they can be easily retrieved at a later date.",UE
"We always use this app because we are always looking for great restaurants. We don't cook a lot, so we make sure there is variety in the places we try. This app never disappoints!",UE

"This app is great, really puts your collection at your disposal! I really like how easy it is to manage your wine collection, buying, drinking or storing notes.",UE
"I started using travel consultants when my husband got a job traveling, and I went with him occasionally. We've been hooked ever since, and I've prevented my parents from finding local gems in restaurants and decent hotels. I love seeing the travel consultant's signs when I go to restaurants now. Anyone can be a critic.",UE
My husband and I always use a travel consultant before the holidays! So much useful information,UE

Best appCan always edit my pictures and they will end well,UE
"The embellishment tool is a good example of this, as it may look good in the preview, but when you save it, you don't always get the same quality. Sometimes it turns out to be a bit pixelated, but overall it's a remarkable app! I use this in conjunction with other apps.",UE
"The best! I like the features, especially the stickers?",UE
Love! Best photo editor out there!,UE
"I use skritter to learn Japanese and it's an application that requires Flash, but I mainly study on my iPhone and probably wouldn't be able to keep up with the SRS if I could just run the program on my computer.

In addition, the nutrition diary makes it easier for me to keep track of what I eat during the day. It's a great app for me! Glad I bought this app!",UE
"I love this app. It's so easy to learn how to use it and it's very easy to understand. The only thing I don't like is that when you choose the option to show how the temperature feels, you can't see what the temperature actually is. I'd love to be able to see both at the same time.",UE
Beautiful display and lots of information instantly,UE

This is a great tool for a quick laboratory consultation.,UE
This is an excellent app to use in the daily devout reading of the readings. Well done!,UE

"I've been using Google Drive for a few months, paid account - the desktop app was totally unreliable and couldn't sync all too often. So I returned to Dropbox, always syncing intelligently and reliablyA bit pricey though - almost twice as expensive as contests if you want the extra space",UE
"I've been waiting for this update, then we get this? EverNote is no longer for taking text notes It's obvious to me now, and I've been denying it for over a year. There's no font check, editing is random and flawed, slow as molasses and unreliable - if you take the time to write a paragraph, you want 100% confidence that EverNote won't crash halfway, or you'll get synchronization errors and lose your job. Note sorting and text-friendly organization (i.e. lists) have been thrown out the window because of a shiny user interface and lots of icons and eye-catching graphics. I can't write with the certainty that EverNote won't crash, but HEY, I can take a photo of my pancakes and keep it for posterity Hey, EverFail, I'm canceling my membership today if you take EverNote seriously as a tool for work, send me an email.",UE

"This app has made my job and my life so much easier! It's available on all platforms and syncs automatically. There are constant updates that I've been using for about a year and I've never had a problem with losing notes. I use these to write my notes for billing, so this part is crucial.

"The most amazing app, certainly the most used on my iPad, but I liked some features of the older version, please bring back the option to create paragraph headings and subsections. Typing might be faster, but still a great app.",UE
"We arrived at Dollar with a reservation at 2 p.m. plus the fast service I signed up for last week. It's been over an hour of queuing now. Hundreds of customers are queuing up, but very few counters are open. There's no seating and crying babies and disappointed families on every corner. Food is on the floor and the place is completely messed up. I'll never rent a garbage dump again. I'd rather walk. If I'd walked to Pasadena, I'd be almost there. Plus the staff is rude and ignorant. No pity for the customers who are standing in that endless line instead of spending Christmas with their families. My daughter and I flew in from New Jersey to visit my mother. Unfortunately, we've scheduled a full dinner tonight. Unfortunately, we're going to wait here in dollars for our pre-reserved rental car. The rush hour starts in 30 minutes, which will end any chance of seeing my family tonight. Shame on Dollar because she didn't properly fill her rental center during the crucial Christmas period.",UE

I used the free app for a long time until I had to find and download a way to use it offline during a recent trip. Enter EveryTrail Pro. This app has practically replaced my GPS device.

"I've been using this app for over 8 months and is by far the best golf GPS for the money. I've ever had a Sky caddie, and he wasn't half as good as this app. Don't waste your money on any of the annual fee GPS units, buy this app and have everything you need. I have the iPhone 4 and only use about half the battery during a 4 1 / 2 to 5 1 / 2-hour round. Turn off your Wi-Fi if it needs more battery life than that.",UE
Excellent WebsiteNothing can go wrong here! But don't join in if you don't have a few hours every day to kill addictive substances!,UE

"Love, this is the fall app",UE
I like the improvements of the user interface with the new version The old user interface was hideous and I used it normally via another app such as Drafts or IFTTT. But the fact that I can't add up-to-date photos from my album!?!?!? That for me is the main feature of Evernote That needs to be fixed!,UE
"Beautiful design update Looks great I love this Dropbox app has completely saved me at work I had to send a number of large files by email and the email system would not accept it Dropbox worked flawlessly Not only did they get links to download the files, but they were also able to view content directly in their web browser PDFs, Word documents and videos, all of which were visible to them in the browser It made presentations a breeze! I now use Dropbox for personal use too",UE
A very fun and easy way to keep up with your heart rate... also pretty precise!!!,UE
Good applications consume more phone memory,UE
"I am extremely excited about the possibilities to keep track of my brochures and clients in a user-friendly way with evernotes. Tag- and search-functions make it easy to call back prospective customers who are interested in certain models --new and used I can arrange the searches to see the latest entries first, which is very important in my business Many other applications work well, but I have an observation you should keep in mind There seems to be an error in the search function for notebooks when you perform a search in a particular notebook. Searching for all notebooks works well, as does the tag search. All in all, this is a great program.",UE
For a few days now. Easy to navigate and understand. Love it. Hope it stays free.,UE
"It's what it says it is, that's refreshing A place to gather all the information that can mess up your life Sure, it takes some work from you to sort it all out, but you've got to get it in one place first That's what Evernote does best It's on my iPhone, iPad and MacBook I use it every day",UE
"Thank you, thank you! It's fixed! I love Pinterest over all the other apps! I now know what it feels like to be dependent on something, but I really enjoy it! It's the easiest way to collect and organize interests and new ideas. It's almost too good to be a really great app! The only drawback I see is when I use Pinterest, time goes sooo fast I recommend this app & tell people who are looking for a specific pattern that I have that pattern on Pinterest!",UE

"I never had much interest in astronomy, but this app changed everything.",UE
"No matter where I travel, it is very precise to use.",UE
"I use this app almost every weekend while exploring byways and trails by motorcycle. Functionality is excellent on the road, and I use the data to check it later with Google Earth. I've tried all the GPS tracking apps, and that's the one I return to every time. I strongly recommend reading the user guide and watching the videos. 10 minutes spent learning the app really pays off how much usage and functionality you get out of the app.",UE
"An absolute must for planning a trip! You have access to restaurants, attractions and hotels with reviews!",UE
I use this site for all my travel needs. Visit the forums to interact with others on your trip!,UE
I see now that you must have IO7 or better for the application I did not want to upgrade to IO7 on my ipad2 and on my original ipadI feel like you threw us out in the cold,UE
"On a visit to the Philippines, I discovered TA when evaluating lodging options. Then I discovered all the related features, which included rich information about local restaurants and attractions. Yelp did not include anything in the Philippines. It is the strong international contribution of users (like me) that makes this app really good.",UE
"Excellent! Everything you need for ideas in one place. Much faster than searching the web, good job fellas!",UE
"I like the openness reflected in the reviews Some people like what I like and others don't. It's usually easy to adapt the review to the reviewer and get a good idea of whether the place and the person like the same things or not as I do. A good source of information for all ""excursions.""",UE
"When a brain tumor all but wiped out my short-term memory, I struggled in all areas of my life - including the work I do on my own, so I have to do my job at all times. Thank you Evernote! I am now regaining some confidence that what I am doing is right!",UE

Great horrible photo editor out there,UE
Great tool to consolidate your notes,UE

"Every time I try to access this app, it crashes and sends me back my homepage. I have to keep trying and try to move on. Apart from the crash, this is a great app, and I will give it 5 stars as soon as the crash problem is fixed.",UE

"I use Dropbox for everything that is readily available on my phone, which has made checking updates of projects from work to sharing articles much easier when I'm not at the computer. Also, it makes it easy to get photos from phone to computer as I never seem to move them Shameless plus here - works great when combined with Ifttt to move captured things to calendar contacts via spreadsheet or special folders",UE
"So much fun! I love to pin projects, recipes and travel ideas, so I can get lost for hours.",UE
"Great AppFound my Canon MX880 printer. Worth it, because none of the other free applications worked to my liking.",UE
"It was soo very helpful in tracking everything that is immediately accessible. It's really amazing. Having worked in the weight loss industry for many years before, I know that this is the key to planning and weight loss. I'm fine with both.",UE
"You should select the folder first and then the files! I would put a folder as a favorite, so all the files within this as a favorite",UE
The graphics are superb and the user interface is very easy to use and navigate. Quiz options and the video are a great bonus feature. I am really happy (especially with the price) and look forward to trying the software of the other systems. Nice work!,UE
"That was a long wait, very happy to have this feature!",UE
The best app ever made for busy people stays with everything and is a great app for people with jobs and hobbies that take up your time,UE
This is a must as you can set it to sync all of your images and once you capture one they will be stored in the cloud and accessible from any other device you have Dropbox installed on and signed in to! An amazing MUST have product and app xx!,UE

"AwesomeI love pinterest its a place where I can keep all the things I like and are interested in, in one place",UE
"I used this app to plan and manage an overseas trip. So far, Ben has weathered a few minor problems well. If I run it in the background on some modes, I think it provides location services where my battery seems to run out faster than usual. I'm not sure if that's it, or if I just use it more than normal. It would be great if there was a way to see my ""savings"" sorted by distance and a way to mark them as seen. Finally, if I use this during my trip, I really don't want to use international roaming to upload a review, but remember that I waited about 5 minutes later and they bother me again, so one star away for that.",UE
"At that moment, I thought I could transfer photos from my iPhone to my laptop faster via Dropbox than plugging my phone into the USB port.",UE
Easy to use and very precise. A must for every traveler!,UE

"/ / Update / / 149 laps logged. iPhone 3GS. Battery 70-80% after rounds left. Still no tracking of secondary games, but the notes function works a bit for that. Finally, five! Six! THE BEST APP FOR GOLF! 17 laps under my belt with this app now and still very happy. I'm blown away by the new in-app stats (v.1.3)! I'm still waiting for secondary games (skins, etc.). I'm baffled why so many golfers leave their phones on the entire round? I take mine off while I'm running to my ball, usually while I'm 20-30 yards away, I get positive satellite lock when I'm standing over the ball, reading my yard and falling asleep again. After flogging it, I can count the entire foursome (takes about 15 seconds in total) and then fall asleep again. I have consistently 80-85% battery life after my round is complete\ / I'll be happy to include a future game\ / GPS\ / even in a game!\ / I\ will be happy to update!",UE
"Convenient! No carrying your laptop or losing a USB flash drive anymore My files are always accessible from any of my devices or others. With three full-time students in the house, this affordable upgrade holds documents, data, music and more! Plenty of space available More practical and affordable than an external drive",UE
I use my iPad to take notes for business meetings. It automatically syncs with my iPhone and laptop.,UE
"I love the search engine and the reviews (although I should read them before going out more often) I give my honest reviews the way I see them and am glad that people can take what I have to say and form their own opinions. I use the site a lot when I travel to find restaurants and accommodation, and some are local and some are not. Therefore, you have to make a personal decision.",UE
"I've been using Evernote since 2005 when I was in college. It's a wonderful service and until the iOS7 redesign, the apps always worked great, but the design of this app is terrible. It's confused, confusing and a lot of advertising for its service add-ons and ""news"" hinders the core functionality. Please revise the app again.",UE
I love being able to work with my phone or laptop. My family tree is always up to date.,UE
"Easy to use for quick, concise notation Would be fantastic if you could work freehand and if compatibility with wireless keyboards would be more efficient example Apple 'Command' key can not control bold underlined italics you still need to use screen",UE
A must for students or anyone who wants to improve their word power!,UE
"And the fact that people freak out about how real it is is the reason I give it a 5. It's based its answers on human responses, so it's very realistic but varies so much.",UE
"I used this for my holidays in Paris, Miami and Cape Cod, where I always find fun activities and good food.",UE
Love the user reviews and pictures,UE
"I've used it countless times now. It was handy, and when I use it, the other party is just as ""wowd"" as I was the first time. I gave it 4 stars because the speech is a bit quirky (it can be iPhone voice recognition problems) and because it's a translator who breaks down a sentence wittily, but when you type or talk like a caveman, it comes across every time.",UE
AddictionI love to pin the things that interest me and watch other people enjoy my attachment.,UE
I'm not sure how I've lived without them. It's best to keep all my important files in one place so I can access them from any device!,UE

"I really love this game, the game is amazing and for being a mobile game, the graphics are stunning.",UE
Love that you can save your stops on a trip for easy reference We really benefited from using Trip Advisor and facilitated the easy access that the app brings with it,UE
"Impressed by its versatility in terms of the type of note you can take It's great to have the ability to type URLs, photos, audio and text and great that it has desktop integration for a computerThe downside I've experienced is that it offers labels that it doesn't offer to edit folders and the dashboard in the app could use a simpler user interface.",UE
"Love the regular website and the app makes it twice as easy to find all your travel information! It's a great reference for travel planning, day trips or local exploration!",UE
I use it all the time I especially like the web clipper and then email directly from Evernote,UE
Love it maybe too much app is easy to use and navigate I use it to search for everything from recipes to gifts to random humor. Maybe I'll need a Pinterest intervention soon!,UE
I used it to plan my business or vacation stays in advance. My wife drew my attention to it. Nice to use if you are looking for restaurants and safe places to visit when I am abroad. I strongly recommend it if you are abroad.,UE

"I'm a very superstitious person. I love any kind of ghost story. Short, long or a book. But this app has everything from short stories to long.",UE
"Evernote is now practically useless I just tried to switch ticks on my shopping list yesterday, and it would take three or more attempts to confirm me, and then suddenly the keyboard would pop up for no reason and the screen and cursor would jump to the bottom of the list. When the program finally recognized me, the ticks were delayed by about 2 seconds each, as if it had to pause and sync between each gesture.",UE
This application was a lifesaver! It actually sinks by remote control with both my iPhone and my iPad. I love it!,UE
It is good and easy to use.,UE
Love the ability to post things the way I do,UE
Great app - nice layout But I wish saved articles could be viewed offline!,UE
"Keep track of everything and everything and just get better and better No matter if it's a document or an image, it can be captured by email or snapshot and you have it forever. It's easy to find it by tags or searches It just makes life easier.",UE
"This app has gone so far for me On my iPod touch 4 generation I have done so much in such a short time Little more than 30 seconds it had created my account and uploaded pictures to there! Although I am busy with it, I trust that this will keep the apps of my and your Apple devices, music, photos, videos and so on safe with all your personal files.)",UE
I never have to take a foreign language course again!!,UE
I love the fact that Evernote allows me to synchronize my notes between each of my devices and computers that I use every day to keep everything right in front of me. I wish the interface was a bit different. Maybe the possibility of color notes?,UE
3 days is not enough. I need at least 5 days. Seems user-friendly and easy to follow. Maybe if it added the ingredients - not multiple entries for the one onion per se.,UE
"I use this app quite a lot to find restaurants and hotels, near and far And I contribute some Definitely worthwhile!",UE
From baby food and diaper changes to shopping lists and research - our family shares everything Thank you Evernote!!,UE

I love the app because it allows me to keep my notes organized and in sync across different devices. I also love the feature of sharing things with friends The only thing I crave is working on notes.,UE
I would like to say that I do not like that the password has to be reset,UE
Great way to save! Thank you,UE
"The editability and consistency on the iPhone has improved with recent updates, and there is still work to be done to allow additional font sizes and the like for items created on the iPhone. However, if a 45 is given for this reason, it would be unfair to rate this with a 4 CC of these minor limitations.",UE
"I like that it gives you more information about the area. So I get more feedback, how is everyone's experience and there is more knowledge where and what to do.",UE
I love that this app takes less than ten seconds to tell you where your battery life is!!! I love it.,UE
Great for daily readings. I love it.,UE
Love trip advisor on the big screen This app brings the usefulness of the iPhone program to the iPad Thanks for a good program Very useful when you're on the go to find the best places Thank you to everyone who takes the time to post reviews that I've been offering for years and glad that others are doing the same,UE

It is worth it. Great tool for checking and spontaneous reference of the moment.,UE
I love the organization and ease that Evernote brings to my life!,UE

App works well for basic bank accounts.,UE
There is also hourly weather for the day!,UE
"This app is a must-have for professionals.

"Finally, an office suite that works great I went through so many office suites and tried to find the suites that best support the most common Microsoft Office suite applications.

"Great app that I used regularly, but since the iOS 7 update and the update of the app itself seems a bit jerky.",UE
"I have to say, on the whole, I like this app, although the logic behind the 15-minute limit on streaming alludes to me that I thought they imposed it to reduce bandwidth, but with the limit it actually increases bandwidth. The reason for this is that I download the whole file and then start streaming as soon as the 15 minutes have expired, I then switch to the downloaded file.",UE
It was so useful to chat and chat me up with all frndsI love these wats up and I enjoy the days chatting with my frnds tks for this innovative idea hats off,UE

"I find most of the music I like, and I can play anywhere I go...",UE
"This app is so fantastic that I find it even better than the website. It's easy to navigate, easy to change and change reservations. There's the option to insert it into your calendar, and it puts all the information directly into your phone calendar. You can just invite your guests via the app (it creates an email for you). A big part of it is that you can only filter your search by 1000 point tables, by neighbourhood, by distance to you and so much more. I use this app regularly - so much so that I'm going to make a reservation that we've just decided to make it easier when we get there! It's such a great app (and the store) that I always wonder why some restaurants don't have it!",UE
Beautiful and smooth photo streaming from device to device,UE

"Great app, huge selection of titles and great free section with many bi-monthly / monthly releases. The only problem is that the viewer hangs up occasionally but not often and a reboot of the app usually helps. Overall, one of the best apps in the entire app store.",UE
"I use evernote for most of my notes, but now I have to pay $5 a month just for a slightly longer note? Ridiculous!",UE
Very helpful when planning your trip.,UE
"Wonderful and very helpful app! Pintrest is a great app because it is very helpful when I want to save websites, photos and recipes!",UE
Easy to find songs and buy on iTunes.,UE
"I just blew $54 to sign up for this app for three months of Weight Watchers, only to find that this app isn't nearly as good as the free app called ""Lose It!"" When my Weight Watchers membership expires, I'll continue to monitor my food intake with Lose It! In the meantime, I'm monitoring my progress with both apps so the transition is smooth. So far, I've found that Lose It! is much faster and easier to use.",UE
Amazing!! ive been using for almost 1yr!!!!!! OmgYou can do so much on this app One of the best photo editor! Love it OMG I just updated it its Heaven!!!!!! Movie is the best omgg!!!,UE
Thank you for the thought and effort that went into creating this app. Very convenient for those of us who love the transitions between nature and nature.,UE
"The only app I couldn't live without! Practical, easy to use, nice design user experience, use several times a day",UE
"Dear Dear Dear Dear I am a craftsman, so when I have time and feel inspired, I come here and browse, I spent completely too much time here, but it is addictive!",UE
Love itExcellent app Easiest way to keep in touch with my dear friends,UE
Very helpful for the home nurse on site.,UE
"Great app!! This made life easy, capturing family moments and saving for years to come I rated pretty few and Evernote are at the top of the list",UE
"This app is really useful for accessing documents while I'm out and about The only big thing I think it lacks is a way to share folders while you're using the app I'd love to be able to share a folder through the app, and I had to do this before while I was out and about, but unfortunately this app as of 3113 doesn't have this feature It would be really useful to have it!",UE
It's great how you can review an area and save the things you want to do in that area for your next visit.,UE
Love itIve never had problems uploads and searches are fine,UE
Error reportNot OK,UE
Finally. A safe place for my private photos. No more worrying about things being seen accidentally. Buy this.,UE
I am a student of nursing and this lab reference is the best I have ever seen or used! It has helped me to understand the labs so well! I highly recommend the app!!!,UE
Excellent!!!! Love love love love!!!! I have so many new recipes and design ideas It is so much fun to see what friends like and pin also,UE
"Now that I have this app, I can't imagine how I got on without it. In my experience, it's about 98% accurate and the spoken directions are a necessity if you're traveling alone. An improvement would be to have the spoken directions a little earlier, especially on a busy highway. I would recommend this app to anyone looking for a reliable, accurate directions.",UE
The best thing I've ever tried??? It??? s been up for a long time.???,UE
"I think this app works better than using my desktop forums. Eat fast to read, search well. I wish it had miniusa and bike forums... Ideal for Tacoma World.",UE
"Some cards are super funny! They are a great way to make someone laugh. Sometimes, I just like to look through them because they are fun to read.",UE
I love it I can pin what I like and send pictures and quotes to my girlfriend,UE
"Good thing is you need people's contacts to get them on whatsapp, but that's the only bad thing about it",UE
"A great app at hand. The pronunciation button is a useful tool if you're not sure if a word is pronounced correctly. Also, several definitions are given to ensure that you use the word in its true context.",UE
"Synchronizing is a bit difficult at first glance, but otherwise wonderful.",UE
My favorite app. It really works! You have to try it.,UE
"EVERY FIRST OF ALL RECEIVES THIS APP IF YOU HAVE A FANTASY TEAM AND CAN ACT YES. CHOOSE THE TEAM, YOU WANT TO ACT WITH AND THEN THE PRESS PROPOSE TRADE TO THE TOP OF THE SCREW!!!!!!",UE
It is a pure pleasure to have a photo when your friends call and sometimes contact information from your FB friends that you did not take the time to acquire. Fabulous!,UE
The new PDF-Reader is GREAT!!,UE
"I use it every time I'm out of time for restaurants and have never done anything wrong. I've tried other food apps that aren't nearly as accurate. A plus is that they don't mess with the ratings of fast food restaurants. Who needs a star rating for McDonalds, Burger King, etc.? Also very good to find a good hotel.",UE
This app works like a charm. You don't have to spend the extra time finding an available partner.,UE
"This has become my most important note-taking program. I wish I could write handwriting on it. Love, how can I store Outlook emails in it?",UE
"Very helpful to have it, but why some reviews aren't published here, I wrote negatively about the Best West Myrtle Beach hotel they don't want to publish. I hope this isn't like a BBB agency paying money to get good reviews.",UE
"I already gave a review when I first downloaded that this app is the best. Well, yesterday it proved to be the best. I have a health condition and yesterday I had to go to the hospital. I just emailed my list, printed it out and could give it to the doctor. Even the nurses and doctors were impressed. However, there is one thing I think would make this app even better. Add a COMMENTS section so you can write comments about yourself or the medication or whatever.",UE
It's a great app for taking notes for lessons on my tablet and still being able to access it over the internet.,UE
Really like this app. It's a very simple way to diary,UE
I find this app very useful. It has mechanisms and class information that most other free programs lack. It can't be done much better (especially for free)!,UE
"Green UI doesn't look good or feel good It's also no useful place to maximize space should be the goal, but it doesn't feel like it The app still works It's clunky and too much advertising Probably it's not even a problem that they've rolled out the ads at the wrong time",UE
I like this app and how I can place articles that I want to review at a later time. I use it to store recipes or interesting articles that I can read at a later time.,UE
"If the stars could be higher, I would rate them as that. I want to become an orthopedic surgeon and this is the best app I've ever come across to learn the skeletal system!!! I would recommend it to anyone, from a surgical intern to an A & P student in high school! Best thing, I can't say it enough!",UE
"I use it to track recipes, take notes on hobbies, keep up with maintenance.",UE
So easy to use!,UE
Absolutely handy for the pictures you don't have to see otherwise.,UE
This app is great for road trips. Children can listen to their music and I can put on headphones and listen to my books.,UE
Exactly the biggest thing I love is that I can spend hours and hours on it! There's nothing I don't like!,UE
"It takes forever to upload photos, 2-3 weeks after I started the photos, it was finally visible. I had no problems installing the latest update. I love the recent upgrades.",UE
Addictive! Love to save things to read them later and find so many clever ideas!!,UE
"Love this app on my iPhone, iPad and computer you all sync Nice Use it on the go to look up restaurants and use it to research all our trips The reviews and forums are great tools for travel",UE
"Love, this saves me having to turn on the light via settings. I use it all the time.",UE
"PC, laptops, droids, tablets, two iPhones and a number of reference documents on all for me and the woman What the hell have I done by sending copies and updates in msgs and handwritten notes, I am so embarrassed that I did not find that 3 years ago?",UE
"As a writing daydreamer, I'm constantly thinking about new ideas, and having a tool to access my material wherever I go is fantastic. Instead of just writing down a note (which I can't always do) and pointing it out later when I get home, logging on to the computer and opening a Word document, it's so much easier and more convenient to do it with this app that I've even used Evernote for school work, essays most of the time, so there's no need to send me documents by email. There are just a few mistakes that I noticed, but nothing that makes me stop using this app, I love it too much!!",UE
"It is as accurate as any weather forecaster paid to get it 100% wrong. So far, this app has been close enough to allow me to dress appropriately, so too much scientific input is important to me. I just don't want to carry an umbrella when the sun is shining.",UE
"I love this app, super simple interface and I use it all the time.",UE
"Very useful, but sometimes it's difficult to type an essay without cross-sectional mode. It's ridiculous how a word-processing app can't type landscape.",UE
Only the required link Perfect solution for my Android / Linux environment. Works well with Tasker.,UE
"Very useful app, have fun looking and seeing what is available.",UE
I used this app recently during Hurricane Isaac. This app was updated faster and was much more reliable than the other two with the big websites. Get it. You may need it when it matters.,UE
Beautiful user interface Keep up the good work!,UE
"great item. Quick, easy ordering. Love fab.",UE
"I have now traveled through the US and several European countries and do not know how I have traveled without it. It has lost sight of the risk of invisible hotels and restaurants and led to many memorable stories. Yes, reviews are not always punctual, but 90% is a huge improvement.",UE
"I've always found Dropbox to be a bit faulty, but it's gotten worse since I upgraded to iOS 7. When I download zip files or web pages and open the files, the screen is blank, blackened, or a blurry enlarged image of the icon (from Facebook, Google, or other icons related to the page that the zip file or web page came from when I was a teacher), I rely on online & amp offline access to do research for my work as a teacher, and I need to write notes & amp as zip files to save space.",UE
"The only reason I switched to iOS7 was to get the latest version of Evernote. I have no idea what everyone is complaining about. Super easy to add notes still No sync issues Mobile phone announcements from Evernote The map indicator is still there, you just have to look (gasping) for a second.",UE
"Honestly, it took me a while to get used to the app - web clipping, photo notes, sharing, etc., but now I find that this app is the ""deal killer"" - the one thing that MUST be on any device - The note scanner is so powerful that it can read my scribbles (take notes in a meeting, take photos in evernote, throw them out!)",UE
"I never book a room without first checking the reviews on this page! I love how I can read reviews from ""real"" people and not what someone in marketing came up with to entice me to stay! I highly recommend it to everyone!",UE
"LOVE IT. From trips with the kids to experiencing new restaurants, I have saved a lot of money. I try to make use of the huge savings on massages and good ones.",UE
The best information about hotels!,UE
"I love that I can have Post-it notes without the post being his love, that I can take notes and jog a memory just by looking at the ""Post-it"" Good App, which I will update when I use up all the space)",UE
"I loved Evernotesthat is Until I download iOS7 With their new and improved look they also eliminated everything you had ever saved. However, they managed to keep the notebook names, unfortunately all the notes in these notebooks were deleted. I used this app for my work and all personal business files disappeared! Be sure to use this app only for unimportant notes Very disappointed - (",UE
"I love its multifunctionality. I am able to make several business and annual expenses, etc.!",UE
"It's great for my brother because he's only four years old, so when Disney comes I can play it for him so he's not on board.",UE
GudEs is a very good way to contact people far away,UE
Very helpful and informative for both countries and overseas,UE
There are so many cool choices??,UE
It allows me to take notes every day that help with medical evaluation. It almost feels like I am cheating my memory.,UE
Great app! Amazing features! Perfect for movie collectors. I love it!,UE
Fantastic app! Makes reading forums so much easier that I do it more now. Great!!,UE
"Love this app, although I wish you could add local stores to your store list",UE
"After downloading this, it just sat on my desktop for a million years. Then I came up with the brilliant idea of taking a screenshot of an Expedia itinerary Wow! Suddenly I'm running off, saving and retrieving information on everything from learning disabilities to salad dressings. I'd rather have layered nesting for the notebooks, but it's pretty cool by the way, I use the Skitch add-on for editing, reformatting, * bold * printing and so on. It's great",UE
I love this app because it helps me keep my finances in order.,UE
The best shoe app ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Correct dates and prices! Let me know everything about the shoe!??,UE
Tell me I was 31 when in 13 very sad app lowers self esteem lol don't get this app it is misleading and very inaccurate don't waste ur time,UE
The best replacement app if your laptop is broken!!,UE
Helpful in finding great lodging and restaurants from South Alabama to Arkansas to Texas,UE
"Mint is a great way to get control of your finances, it really helps you with your spending and makes you aware of what you are spending your money on.",UE
"I use it when we travel, I'd rather find places and read reviews that others have published that I visit, and then post my thoughts. So far, those who use and rate places are very fair and honest.",UE
The other reason I got the app is that it can be exported to QuickBooks even though I haven't used it yet. The reports are great. I'd love to have main categories and sub-categories. I think that's the only thing missing to make this app a really robust standalone financial management app. Keep it up!,UE
Extremely helpful in France We were only in restaurants rated by TA,UE
"I wanted an app that separates my videos from my photo archive. I wanted to be able to play my photo slideshow without interrupting annoying videos. Music stops and you have to start over. Now, the videos are on this app and I can play through all my images.",UE
"I have been using Evernote forfiver for a year now, very easy to use program, love syncing with my desktop, phone, iPad, etc.",UE
It's probably every time! I have all of One Direction even Cher Lloyd! I love this app??????,UE

Best cross-platform app of all time! The idea of a seamlessly connected world comes to life Simply brilliant!,UE
Continue to amaze... with information and views of stellar objects.,UE
Bezt app ever.. And very convenient for local and international texts,UE
"It is wonderful that I keep recipes, receipts, knitting patterns, copies of postcards and greeting cards from friends, car maintenance documents, equipment manuals, part numbers for equipment parts and many other things that I drive for my favorite sports teams, information about places I want to visit on my next trip to different cities, business cards and magazine articles that I use at work.",UE
"Cross-platform access to your notes in the cloud is brilliant and a huge time saver! This app, combined with the inexpensive Bluetooth keyboard I recently purchased, has given me a powerful mobile ability to collect and organize information.",UE
"Notes app no longer required with all these features Between my Mac, iPhone and working with IE and desktop app, it's easy to save from the web and edit notes as needed",UE
"Well, I like it. That's right.",UE
"I've been using this for just over 6 weeks and have eliminated all paper notes. Even when I'm in a meeting without a laptop or iPad, my paper notes can be easily loaded by simply snapping a photo. In addition, classifying a note by notebook and adding tags makes it easy to spread them over a few different dimensions so they can be easily retrieved at a later date.",UE
"We always use this app because we are always looking for great restaurants. We don't cook a lot, so we make sure there is variety in the places we try. This app never disappoints!",UE
"Did not give 5 stars because not all campsites are listed. Sure is helpful although 99.5% of the time. Have used for gas, reservations for camp, restaurant locations, short distances. Great!",UE
"I've been working for TripAdvisor for many years. It's the first place I check when I go to a new area to get information about hotels, restaurants and activities, and the app on my iPad makes it easy for me to post reviews on the go.",UE
Great app for travelers. Highly recommended!,UE
Without this it is literally impossible to play music on my Xbox! Thank you! Happy Birthday??,UE
Inspiring! It's fun to collect your favorite things and try to express your preferences and interests to others.,UE
I love this app. I scan whatever I see....,UE
Like the visuals of this app very much like how it updates the weather to find out where you are:),UE
"It's nice not to have to wait until I get home to type the next chapter of my book, and I don't have to carry my folder full of notebook paper around with me.",UE
"Video Playback sucksThis is a wonderful app minus the videos To play one it takes you to an internet browser, then to youtube Please allow for in-app playback to bypass all the nonsense",UE
Easy to use Not driven by advertising Always full of things that interest me without chasing me or interrupting my enjoyment with endless advertising,UE
Who doesn't like a good deal now and then? Usually something for everyone and a simple user interface. Pretty thorough app.,UE
No more magazine clippings A place for to-do lists I'd love to see the ability to set alarms and send reminders One of my most popular and versatile apps,UE
"Love the app, use it all the time to check ship activity in Puget Sound. Helpful whether on land or on the water.",UE
"I started to use evernote since high school, but did not feel so useful Now I am college student, I use evernote in every life I love the highlights section, but wish there were more color than yellow In addition, I also like the website version It is organized and refined Thank you for providing this application It is so convenient",UE
"I have over 200 notes in Evernote (verified in the Mac version and on Evernotecom), but only 4 of them appeared in the new version of this app until I deleted them and re-installed Login and Login did not work The new interface will take some getting used to, but feels cleaner and faster than before",UE
"I must say that Evernote is in the top 3 ranking of my productivity apps, if not number 1. So easy to use, I use it to store all sorts of data that I can quickly remember Great for notes, recipes, software keys, wifi settings Endless applications",UE
"Used in the US, Ireland and continental Europe, good information such as location, numbers and website reviews are personal preferences, but knowledge of a majority opinion makes it easier to select locations and events.",UE
Easy-to-find venues Great to be steered to good places,UE
The reason I really like this app is that real people like me actually use the app and write the review. It's hard to blow smoke with so many of us using it now.,UE
Easy to use and very precise I always go to travel consultant to see opinions whether the good reviews are or not Thanks for the great app,UE
"This app is great, really puts your collection at your disposal! I really like how easy it is to manage your wine collection, buying, drinking or storing notes.",UE
"I started using travel consultants when my husband got a job traveling, and I went with him occasionally. We've been hooked ever since, and I've prevented my parents from finding local gems in restaurants and decent hotels. I love seeing the travel consultant's signs when I go to restaurants now. Anyone can be a critic.",UE
My husband and I always use a travel consultant before the holidays! So much useful information,UE
"This is a great app for planning a trip, if you want to go anywhere, definitely take advantage of this!! It helps me find restaurants in cities I've never visited, and great deals on flights and hotels",UE
This app made the search very easy and fast.,UE
Best appCan always edit my pictures and they will end well,UE
"The embellishment tool is a good example of this, as it may look good in the preview, but when you save it, you don't always get the same quality. Sometimes it turns out to be a bit pixelated, but overall it's a remarkable app! I use this in conjunction with other apps.",UE
"The best! I like the features, especially the stickers?",UE
Love! Best photo editor out there!,UE
"I use skritter to learn Japanese and it's an application that requires Flash, but I mainly study on my iPhone and probably wouldn't be able to keep up with the SRS if I could just run the program on my computer. Thanks to Splashtop I can now practice on the go. (That sounds like an infomercial lol)",UE
Dropbox works great I can access files anywhere Highly recommended,UE
Syncs well and wonderfully for projects at work and at home,UE
Very easy to use!!!,UE
"Easy to find what you want and narrow down the search, the photo gallery feature is great if your first filter looks the way it does.",UE
I am ten and this stuff does not scare me and I am 10 years old!!!!,UE
I love this app c: now I can take a photo of myself without having to hold it as usual -.- < 3,UE
Love this appLets you keep all the things you find interesting in one place,UE
"I have been a P90X customer for some time and I love working out! With the P90X app, I now have the opportunity to do my workouts at the gym or when I travel with me. In addition, the nutrition diary makes it easier for me to keep track of what I eat during the day. It's a great app for me! Glad I bought this app!",UE
"I love this app. It's so easy to learn how to use it and it's very easy to understand. The only thing I don't like is that when you choose the option to show how the temperature feels, you can't see what the temperature actually is. I'd love to be able to see both at the same time.",UE
Beautiful display and lots of information instantly,UE
"After having tried many organizers over the past year, I have settled into Evernote. It is the easiest and most intuitive to use, synchronizes so easily with the laptop.",UE
"I tried Google Drive, Box, Skydrive, but none of them were able to upload a 20-minute video that I recorded with Dropbox. Dropbox was the only one that accepted my file.",UE
"I am really amazed at how well this app works.. the thing that strikes me most is the fact that when I record my voice for the translation, IT UNDERSTAND ME!! I have a very deep voice and I have never had any kind of software that was able to take what I said and convert it to the right version.. I am very, very satisfied with this app.. you should get it?",UE
Great app to write my reviews! Very user-friendly and easy to navigate,UE
I love this app use it all the time! Helps me know what to expect on the go Helps me get the most bang for my buck,UE
"Great app, always works and is always on the spot!",UE
"I've used other note-taking apps before, but this is my favorite, I haven't even started scratching the surface of all its capabilities, but I love the fact that it can be synced across all my devices. My notes are easy to find. It would be great if there was a way to hide some of my notebooks with a password for secure data, which is the only reason I gave it four stars instead of five.",UE
This is a great tool for a quick laboratory consultation.,UE
This is an excellent app to use in the daily devout reading of the readings. Well done!,UE
"Live sky doesn't work via my touch. Also, I can't find my correct location. As close as the Droid app is to being... but turned off by parsec.",UE
"I've been using Google Drive for a few months, paid account - the desktop app was totally unreliable and couldn't sync all too often. So I returned to Dropbox, always syncing intelligently and reliablyA bit pricey though - almost twice as expensive as contests if you want the extra space",UE
"I've been waiting for this update, then we get this? EverNote is no longer for taking text notes It's obvious to me now, and I've been denying it for over a year. There's no font check, editing is random and flawed, slow as molasses and unreliable - if you take the time to write a paragraph, you want 100% confidence that EverNote won't crash halfway, or you'll get synchronization errors and lose your job. Note sorting and text-friendly organization (i.e. lists) have been thrown out the window because of a shiny user interface and lots of icons and eye-catching graphics. I can't write with the certainty that EverNote won't crash, but HEY, I can take a photo of my pancakes and keep it for posterity Hey, EverFail, I'm canceling my membership today if you take EverNote seriously as a tool for work, send me an email.",UE
"This is a great educational app for students, especially for the movies! It offers a great look for abstract content.",UE
This app is a good time. Fun at parties.,UE
Very easy to use on any device or operating system,UE
"My areas of application are primarily restaurants & amp; attractions, paying attention to reviews that have been written in recent months. Reviews from longtime travelers and review writers are very helpful.",UE
Especially the memory!,UE
"In fact, I think this app is absolutely brilliant when it comes to helping me prepare for my boards. However, just as the muscle name is indicated in the audio, I wish there was an option to hear all the information about the muscles in the audio.",UE
"I always use this app when we have travel plans as I rely on reviews to help us make travel decisions about where to stay, where to visit, etc.",UE
"This app has made my job and my life so much easier! It's available on all platforms and syncs automatically. There are constant updates that I've been using for about a year and I've never had a problem with losing notes. I use these to write my notes for billing, so this part is crucial. Thank you for making my life easier!!",UE
Love this app! Very precise. Quick response.,UE
"PerfectI love this app, I have it on all my devices and use it all the time for fun effects to get the perfect picture",UE
Have fun. Great learning tool.,UE
I love this ap use it on the go but also to store travel information to easily access Also like web integration,UE
"The more I use Evernote, the more opportunities I find to use it love the excellent and consistent multi-platform experience and synchronization",UE
BeautifulKeep it up.. this far is the usable app editor.. it makes my photos more beautiful and alive..,UE
"Great SharingLove to be able to search and find exactly what I want! Also makes preparing a menu easier! It's fantastic to have exactly what I've organized, just for me!",UE
Great for planning in the USA and abroad,UE
"There's always room for improvement, but this app has replaced no fewer than 3 other apps, and now with reminders it's my go-to app for pretty much anything to do with tasks or projects.",UE
"Great app for David Allen's ""Getting Things Done"" organizing techniques syncs instantly with iPhone, iPad and Mac so you always have access to everything you need no matter where you are. I use this app to keep track of everything from work tasks, household chores, shopping lists and ideas for the future without messing them up. Check out TheSecretWeaponorg for ideas on how to set up your Evernote to stay organized. Great app!!!",UE
"Not worth the time, unless you want to be disappointed",UE
I downloaded the city app during my trip and was very glad that the maps worked without data.,UE
"Best app to share thoughts, ideas and different things and feelings Excellent way to connect with our family, friends, relatives and strangers)))))",UE
Easy way to get in touch with people,UE
"ExcellentFrom the developers of the best file manager for Android. Works like a charm on my S4, Droid Razr and Note II.",UE
"I have used this program for over a year, now I use it for all my notes that no longer take pads! Easy to share information with employees with a few keystrokes A great app",UE
"This app is great for the newbie. I've just taken up a new position in my company that requires me to travel, and I always refer to Trip Advisor for reviews of hotels and good places to get a hot meal. I highly recommend this app!",UE
"The most amazing app, certainly the most used on my iPad, but I liked some features of the older version, please bring back the option to create paragraph headings and subsections. Typing might be faster, but still a great app.",UE
"We arrived at Dollar with a reservation at 2 p.m. plus the fast service I signed up for last week. It's been over an hour of queuing now. Hundreds of customers are queuing up, but very few counters are open. There's no seating and crying babies and disappointed families on every corner. Food is on the floor and the place is completely messed up. I'll never rent a garbage dump again. I'd rather walk. If I'd walked to Pasadena, I'd be almost there. Plus the staff is rude and ignorant. No pity for the customers who are standing in that endless line instead of spending Christmas with their families. My daughter and I flew in from New Jersey to visit my mother. Unfortunately, we've scheduled a full dinner tonight. Unfortunately, we're going to wait here in dollars for our pre-reserved rental car. The rush hour starts in 30 minutes, which will end any chance of seeing my family tonight. Shame on Dollar because she didn't properly fill her rental center during the crucial Christmas period.",UE
It has some really cool and interesting tattoos,UE
Fort Lauderdale. Il Lugano gives us the feeling of royalty! Friendly and bent over to relax at the end of a long day of travel. Great app with great hotels!,UE
"TripAdvisor is a great website that provides the traveler with excellent, reasonable and important information no matter where you go. Restaurant conditions, costs, staff service and much more are available to you. Feedback is provided by actual travelers so that you are provided with honest results. A unique place to check if you are not sure!",UE
Very good. Your prognosis is always up-to-date and precise!,UE
I have just started using the app for the holiday we are on in South Africa. Restaurant reviews are invaluable when it comes to navigating the options available in the area.,UE
"I have been using EveryTrail.com for years - I love its ease of use and am looking to upload my tours and embed the maps into my blog. I used the free app for a long time until I had to find and download a way to use it offline during a recent trip. Enter EveryTrail Pro. This app has practically replaced my GPS device. I adjust the GPS settings to extend battery life, and I can go on epic tours and still have power to text photos of my friends from the trail.",UE
"Many topics, something for everyone",UE
"HIS ONE MY CHANGE AND MY MY PEOPLE APPLES TO MY IPOD I USE TO WRITTEN JOURNAL ENTRIES, TAKES CONDITIONS IN CHURCHES, COMPETITIONS, ONE OF IF IF NOT A CONDITION OF A HAND HANDS (And believe me, I have tried many of them!)",UE
"Very convenient, useful information and easy to use",UE
"Great app (& amp website) Extremely useful real life reviews are always better than sales brochures and recommendations I use them often, even when I'm not traveling. Fun to explore this app creates travel dreams and a great education.",UE
Get the app before you leave or after you arrive. You'll get great information about food reviews that you can use during your stay to enjoy the experience of your holiday.,UE
Love reading the information and reviews Very helpful in deciding where I want to go and stay,UE
Easy to use. Works fine. Countless books to choose from. I'm a fan.,UE

Great app to watch the weather.,UE
It's a fantastic way to keep track of your thoughts!,UE
"I've been using this app for over 8 months and is by far the best golf GPS for the money. I've ever had a Sky caddie, and he wasn't half as good as this app. Don't waste your money on any of the annual fee GPS units, buy this app and have everything you need. I have the iPhone 4 and only use about half the battery during a 4 1 / 2 to 5 1 / 2-hour round. Turn off your Wi-Fi if it needs more battery life than that.",UE
Excellent WebsiteNothing can go wrong here! But don't join in if you don't have a few hours every day to kill addictive substances!,UE
"This is a great app for organizing notes, recipes, etc. on any device I use both at home and at work. I type information on my iPhone, iPad or PC.",UE

This is a great app for a family on a bus,UE
"Love, this is the fall app",UE
I like the improvements of the user interface with the new version The old user interface was hideous and I used it normally via another app such as Drafts or IFTTT. But the fact that I can't add up-to-date photos from my album!?!?!? That for me is the main feature of Evernote That needs to be fixed!,UE
"Beautiful design update Looks great I love this Dropbox app has completely saved me at work I had to send a number of large files by email and the email system would not accept it Dropbox worked flawlessly Not only did they get links to download the files, but they were also able to view content directly in their web browser PDFs, Word documents and videos, all of which were visible to them in the browser It made presentations a breeze! I now use Dropbox for personal use too",UE
A very fun and easy way to keep up with your heart rate... also pretty precise!!!,UE
Good applications consume more phone memory,UE
"I am extremely excited about the possibilities to keep track of my brochures and clients in a user-friendly way with evernotes. Tag- and search-functions make it easy to call back prospective customers who are interested in certain models --new and used I can arrange the searches to see the latest entries first, which is very important in my business Many other applications work well, but I have an observation you should keep in mind There seems to be an error in the search function for notebooks when you perform a search in a particular notebook. Searching for all notebooks works well, as does the tag search. All in all, this is a great program.",UE
For a few days now. Easy to navigate and understand. Love it. Hope it stays free.,UE
"It's what it says it is, that's refreshing A place to gather all the information that can mess up your life Sure, it takes some work from you to sort it all out, but you've got to get it in one place first That's what Evernote does best It's on my iPhone, iPad and MacBook I use it every day",UE

"No matter where I travel, it is very precise to use.",UE
"I use this app almost every weekend while exploring byways and trails by motorcycle. Functionality is excellent on the road, and I use the data to check it later with Google Earth. I've tried all the GPS tracking apps, and that's the one I return to every time. I strongly recommend reading the user guide and watching the videos. 10 minutes spent learning the app really pays off how much usage and functionality you get out of the app.",UE

"On a visit to the Philippines, I discovered TA when evaluating lodging options. Then I discovered all the related features, which included rich information about local restaurants and attractions.

"Excellent! Everything you need for ideas in one place. Much faster than searching the web, good job fellas!",UE
"I like the openness reflected in the reviews Some people like what I like and others don't. It's usually easy to adapt the review to the reviewer and get a good idea of whether the place and the person like the same things or not as I do. A good source of information for all ""excursions.""",UE
"When a brain tumor all but wiped out my short-term memory, I struggled in all areas of my life - including the work I do on my own, so I have to do my job at all times. Thank you Evernote! I am now regaining some confidence that what I am doing is right!",UE

"I use Dropbox for everything that is readily available on my phone, which has made checking updates of projects from work to sharing articles much easier when I'm not at the computer.

"So much fun! I love to pin projects, recipes and travel ideas, so I can get lost for hours.",UE
"Great AppFound my Canon MX880 printer. Worth it, because none of the other free applications worked to my liking.",UE

"You should select the folder first and then the files! I would put a folder as a favorite, so all the files within this as a favorite",UE

"AwesomeI love pinterest its a place where I can keep all the things I like and are interested in, in one place",UE
"I used this app to plan and manage an overseas trip. So far, Ben has weathered a few minor problems well. If I run it in the background on some modes, I think it provides location services where my battery seems to run out faster than usual. I'm not sure if that's it, or if I just use it more than normal. It would be great if there was a way to see my ""savings"" sorted by distance and a way to mark them as seen. Finally, if I use this during my trip, I really don't want to use international roaming to upload a review, but remember that I waited about 5 minutes later and they bother me again, so one star away for that.",UE
"At that moment, I thought I could transfer photos from my iPhone to my laptop faster via Dropbox than plugging my phone into the USB port.",UE

"/ / Update / / 149 laps logged. iPhone 3GS. Battery 70-80% after rounds left. Still no tracking of secondary games, but the notes function works a bit for that. Finally, five! Six! THE BEST APP FOR GOLF! 17 laps under my belt with this app now and still very happy. I'm blown away by the new in-app stats (v.1.3)! I'm still waiting for secondary games (skins, etc.). I'm baffled why so many golfers leave their phones on the entire round? I take mine off while I'm running to my ball, usually while I'm 20-30 yards away, I get positive satellite lock when I'm standing over the ball, reading my yard and falling asleep again. After flogging it, I can count the entire foursome (takes about 15 seconds in total) and then fall asleep again. I have consistently 80-85% battery life after my round is complete\ / I'll be happy to include a future game\ / GPS\ / even in a game!\ / I\ will be happy to update!",UE

I use my iPad to take notes for business meetings. It automatically syncs with my iPhone and laptop.,UE
"I love the search engine and the reviews (although I should read them before going out more often) I give my honest reviews the way I see them and am glad that people can take what I have to say and form their own opinions. I use the site a lot when I travel to find restaurants and accommodation, and some are local and some are not. Therefore, you have to make a personal decision.",UE
"I've been using Evernote since 2005 when I was in college. It's a wonderful service and until the iOS7 redesign, the apps always worked great, but the design of this app is terrible. It's confused, confusing and a lot of advertising for its service add-ons and ""news"" hinders the core functionality. Please revise the app again.",UE
I love being able to work with my phone or laptop. My family tree is always up to date.,UE
"Easy to use for quick, concise notation Would be fantastic if you could work freehand and if compatibility with wireless keyboards would be more efficient example Apple 'Command' key can not control bold underlined italics you still need to use screen",UE
A must for students or anyone who wants to improve their word power!,UE
"And the fact that people freak out about how real it is is the reason I give it a 5. It's based its answers on human responses, so it's very realistic but varies so much.",UE
"I used this for my holidays in Paris, Miami and Cape Cod, where I always find fun activities and good food.",UE
Love the user reviews and pictures,UE
"I've used it countless times now. It was handy, and when I use it, the other party is just as ""wowd"" as I was the first time. I gave it 4 stars because the speech is a bit quirky (it can be iPhone voice recognition problems) and because it's a translator who breaks down a sentence wittily, but when you type or talk like a caveman, it comes across every time.",UE
AddictionI love to pin the things that interest me and watch other people enjoy my attachment.,UE
I'm not sure how I've lived without them. It's best to keep all my important files in one place so I can access them from any device!,UE

Love that you can save your stops on a trip for easy reference We really benefited from using Trip Advisor and facilitated the easy access that the app brings with it,UE
"Impressed by its versatility in terms of the type of note you can take It's great to have the ability to type URLs, photos, audio and text and great that it has desktop integration for a computerThe downside I've experienced is that it offers labels that it doesn't offer to edit folders and the dashboard in the app could use a simpler user interface.",UE
"Love the regular website and the app makes it twice as easy to find all your travel information! It's a great reference for travel planning, day trips or local exploration!",UE
I use it all the time I especially like the web clipper and then email directly from Evernote,UE

"Evernote is now practically useless I just tried to switch ticks on my shopping list yesterday, and it would take three or more attempts to confirm me, and then suddenly the keyboard would pop up for no reason and the screen and cursor would jump to the bottom of the list. When the program finally recognized me, the ticks were delayed by about 2 seconds each, as if it had to pause and sync between each gesture.",UE

Great app - nice layout But I wish saved articles could be viewed offline!,UE

"This app has gone so far for me On my iPod touch 4 generation I have done so much in such a short time Little more than 30 seconds it had created my account and uploaded pictures to there! Although I am busy with it, I trust that this will keep the apps of my and your Apple devices, music, photos, videos and so on safe with all your personal files.)",UE
I never have to take a foreign language course again!!,UE
I love the fact that Evernote allows me to synchronize my notes between each of my devices and computers that I use every day to keep everything right in front of me. I wish the interface was a bit different. Maybe the possibility of color notes?,UE
3 days is not enough. I need at least 5 days. Seems user-friendly and easy to follow. Maybe if it added the ingredients - not multiple entries for the one onion per se.,UE

Great way to save! Thank you,UE
"The editability and consistency on the iPhone has improved with recent updates, and there is still work to be done to allow additional font sizes and the like for items created on the iPhone. However, if a 45 is given for this reason, it would be unfair to rate this with a 4 CC of these minor limitations.",UE
"I like that it gives you more information about the area. So I get more feedback, how is everyone's experience and there is more knowledge where and what to do.",UE

Great app that is very user-friendly,UE
"The Travel Advisor app was extremely useful for our honeymoon in Puerto Rico! We couldn't plan much in advance, so the Travel Advisor app helped us to have a great experience! Thank you! D",UE
This app was easy to use. I'm so glad I found it!,UE
"It was very helpful in booking a room, food, etc., the few times I have used it",UE
"I trust Dropbox to synchronize daily annotated PDFs from my iPad to my home computer After today's update, synchronization no longer works",UE
"I've been using Advisor for years, and it seems like I'm about to give it a rating, with such a wide variety of focus areas like restaurants, hotels and attractions, and a huge user base that exponentially adds value to the app.",UE
"I can't leave the house without finally downloading the app to my phone, which I used to only use with my computer. I'm now planning my entire trip to Key West with a travel consultant. Thank you.",UE
Found this app very useful for finding restaurants and lodging when traveling and at home Also found great hidden treasures and places to avoid,UE
Love this app. You decide how you want your collage. You should add more different frames.,UE
"This app is just like the website, except you have to choose an area instead of having it laid out for you. I love this app and use it every day!",UE
"Great app that I used regularly, but since the iOS 7 update and the update of the app itself seems a bit jerky.",UE
"I have to say, on the whole, I like this app, although the logic behind the 15-minute limit on streaming alludes to me that I thought they imposed it to reduce bandwidth, but with the limit it actually increases bandwidth. The reason for this is that I download the whole file and then start streaming as soon as the 15 minutes have expired, I then switch to the downloaded file.",UE
It was so useful to chat and chat me up with all frndsI love these wats up and I enjoy the days chatting with my frnds tks for this innovative idea hats off,UE
"We use this app when we travel or when planning a trip. Without the helpful reviews when deciding on hotels, restaurants and coach facilities, we would get lost.",UE
A wonderful substitute for the loss of brain function in middle age.,UE
"I own a limousine company and all my drivers use it to track their customers ""flights.",UE
"I find most of the music I like, and I can play anywhere I go...",UE
"This app is so fantastic that I find it even better than the website. It's easy to navigate, easy to change and change reservations. There's the option to insert it into your calendar, and it puts all the information directly into your phone calendar. You can just invite your guests via the app (it creates an email for you). A big part of it is that you can only filter your search by 1000 point tables, by neighbourhood, by distance to you and so much more. I use this app regularly - so much so that I'm going to make a reservation that we've just decided to make it easier when we get there! It's such a great app (and the store) that I always wonder why some restaurants don't have it!",UE
Beautiful and smooth photo streaming from device to device,UE
I was hoping to replace Yelp and Foursquare with Trip Advisor Disappointed I won't be able to find the deal breaker: you can't check in at one place,UE
"Brilliant app, but crashes on iPad and iPhone",UE
"Flawless operation - ZERO issues Easy operation - almost effortless New automatic uploading of photos and videos is a great & amp; useful addition Customer service is second to none (if I had a question, support answered it before two hours had passed)",UE
It is too user-friendly to use Picsart is fun!!,UE
I love the new design for iOS 7,UE
Audio books and e-books from the library This app is wonderful!,UE
GooD AppVery user-friendly,UE
HmmmI love Pinterest!! My app won't allow me to share my Pins with Facebook,UE
I love having travel advisors on my iPhone and iPad - I discovered the cunning point where I have feature Awesome for us directionally challenged people,UE
Cooooool App??????,UE
"Great app, huge selection of titles and great free section with many bi-monthly / monthly releases. The only problem is that the viewer hangs up occasionally but not often and a reboot of the app usually helps. Overall, one of the best apps in the entire app store.",UE
"I use evernote for most of my notes, but now I have to pay $5 a month just for a slightly longer note? Ridiculous!",UE
Very helpful when planning your trip.,UE
"Wonderful and very helpful app! Pintrest is a great app because it is very helpful when I want to save websites, photos and recipes!",UE
Easy to find songs and buy on iTunes.,UE
"I just blew $54 to sign up for this app for three months of Weight Watchers, only to find that this app isn't nearly as good as the free app called ""Lose It!"" When my Weight Watchers membership expires, I'll continue to monitor my food intake with Lose It! In the meantime, I'm monitoring my progress with both apps so the transition is smooth. So far, I've found that Lose It! is much faster and easier to use.",UE
Amazing!! ive been using for almost 1yr!!!!!! OmgYou can do so much on this app One of the best photo editor! Love it OMG I just updated it its Heaven!!!!!! Movie is the best omgg!!!,UE
Thank you for the thought and effort that went into creating this app. Very convenient for those of us who love the transitions between nature and nature.,UE

"Dear Dear Dear Dear I am a craftsman, so when I have time and feel inspired, I come here and browse, I spent completely too much time here, but it is addictive!",UE
Love itExcellent app Easiest way to keep in touch with my dear friends,UE
Very helpful for the home nurse on site.,UE
"Great app!! This made life easy, capturing family moments and saving for years to come I rated pretty few and Evernote are at the top of the list",UE
"This app is really useful for accessing documents while I'm out and about The only big thing I think it lacks is a way to share folders while you're using the app I'd love to be able to share a folder through the app, and I had to do this before while I was out and about, but unfortunately this app as of 3113 doesn't have this feature It would be really useful to have it!",UE
It's great how you can review an area and save the things you want to do in that area for your next visit.,UE
Love itIve never had problems uploads and searches are fine,UE
Error reportNot OK,UE
Finally. A safe place for my private photos. No more worrying about things being seen accidentally. Buy this.,UE

Excellent!!!! Love love love love!!!! I have so many new recipes and design ideas It is so much fun to see what friends like and pin also,UE
"Now that I have this app, I can't imagine how I got on without it. In my experience, it's about 98% accurate and the spoken directions are a necessity if you're traveling alone. An improvement would be to have the spoken directions a little earlier, especially on a busy highway. I would recommend this app to anyone looking for a reliable, accurate directions.",UE
The best thing I've ever tried??? It??? s been up for a long time.???,UE
"I think this app works better than using my desktop forums. Eat fast to read, search well. I wish it had miniusa and bike forums... Ideal for Tacoma World.",UE
"Some cards are super funny! They are a great way to make someone laugh. Sometimes, I just like to look through them because they are fun to read.",UE
I love it I can pin what I like and send pictures and quotes to my girlfriend,UE
"Good thing is you need people's contacts to get them on whatsapp, but that's the only bad thing about it",UE
"A great app at hand. The pronunciation button is a useful tool if you're not sure if a word is pronounced correctly. Also, several definitions are given to ensure that you use the word in its true context.",UE
"Synchronizing is a bit difficult at first glance, but otherwise wonderful.",UE
My favorite app. It really works! You have to try it.,UE
"EVERY FIRST OF ALL RECEIVES THIS APP IF YOU HAVE A FANTASY TEAM AND CAN ACT YES. CHOOSE THE TEAM, YOU WANT TO ACT WITH AND THEN THE PRESS PROPOSE TRADE TO THE TOP OF THE SCREW!!!!!!",UE
It is a pure pleasure to have a photo when your friends call and sometimes contact information from your FB friends that you did not take the time to acquire. Fabulous!,UE
The new PDF-Reader is GREAT!!,UE
"I use it every time I'm out of time for restaurants and have never done anything wrong. I've tried other food apps that aren't nearly as accurate. A plus is that they don't mess with the ratings of fast food restaurants. Who needs a star rating for McDonalds, Burger King, etc.? Also very good to find a good hotel.",UE
This app works like a charm. You don't have to spend the extra time finding an available partner.,UE
"This has become my most important note-taking program. I wish I could write handwriting on it. Love, how can I store Outlook emails in it?",UE
"Very helpful to have it, but why some reviews aren't published here, I wrote negatively about the Best West Myrtle Beach hotel they don't want to publish. I hope this isn't like a BBB agency paying money to get good reviews.",UE
"I already gave a review when I first downloaded that this app is the best. Well, yesterday it proved to be the best. I have a health condition and yesterday I had to go to the hospital. I just emailed my list, printed it out and could give it to the doctor. Even the nurses and doctors were impressed. However, there is one thing I think would make this app even better. Add a COMMENTS section so you can write comments about yourself or the medication or whatever.",UE
It's a great app for taking notes for lessons on my tablet and still being able to access it over the internet.,UE
Really like this app. It's a very simple way to diary,UE
I find this app very useful. It has mechanisms and class information that most other free programs lack. It can't be done much better (especially for free)!,UE
"Green UI doesn't look good or feel good It's also no useful place to maximize space should be the goal, but it doesn't feel like it The app still works It's clunky and too much advertising Probably it's not even a problem that they've rolled out the ads at the wrong time",UE
I like this app and how I can place articles that I want to review at a later time. I use it to store recipes or interesting articles that I can read at a later time.,UE
"If the stars could be higher, I would rate them as that. I want to become an orthopedic surgeon and this is the best app I've ever come across to learn the skeletal system!!! I would recommend it to anyone, from a surgical intern to an A & P student in high school! Best thing, I can't say it enough!",UE
"I use it to track recipes, take notes on hobbies, keep up with maintenance.",UE
So easy to use!,UE
Absolutely handy for the pictures you don't have to see otherwise.,UE
This app is great for road trips. Children can listen to their music and I can put on headphones and listen to my books.,UE
Exactly the biggest thing I love is that I can spend hours and hours on it! There's nothing I don't like!,UE
"It takes forever to upload photos, 2-3 weeks after I started the photos, it was finally visible. I had no problems installing the latest update. I love the recent upgrades.",UE
Addictive! Love to save things to read them later and find so many clever ideas!!,UE
"Love this app on my iPhone, iPad and computer you all sync Nice Use it on the go to look up restaurants and use it to research all our trips The reviews and forums are great tools for travel",UE
"Love, this saves me having to turn on the light via settings. I use it all the time.",UE
"PC, laptops, droids, tablets, two iPhones and a number of reference documents on all for me and the woman What the hell have I done by sending copies and updates in msgs and handwritten notes, I am so embarrassed that I did not find that 3 years ago?",UE
"As a writing daydreamer, I'm constantly thinking about new ideas, and having a tool to access my material wherever I go is fantastic. Instead of just writing down a note (which I can't always do) and pointing it out later when I get home, logging on to the computer and opening a Word document, it's so much easier and more convenient to do it with this app that I've even used Evernote for school work, essays most of the time, so there's no need to send me documents by email. There are just a few mistakes that I noticed, but nothing that makes me stop using this app, I love it too much!!",UE
"It is as accurate as any weather forecaster paid to get it 100% wrong. So far, this app has been close enough to allow me to dress appropriately, so too much scientific input is important to me. I just don't want to carry an umbrella when the sun is shining.",UE
"I love this app, super simple interface and I use it all the time.",UE
"Very useful, but sometimes it's difficult to type an essay without cross-sectional mode. It's ridiculous how a word-processing app can't type landscape.",UE
Only the required link Perfect solution for my Android / Linux environment. Works well with Tasker.,UE
"Very useful app, have fun looking and seeing what is available.",UE
I used this app recently during Hurricane Isaac. This app was updated faster and was much more reliable than the other two with the big websites. Get it. You may need it when it matters.,UE
Beautiful user interface Keep up the good work!,UE
"great item. Quick, easy ordering. Love fab.",UE
"I have now traveled through the US and several European countries and do not know how I have traveled without it. It has lost sight of the risk of invisible hotels and restaurants and led to many memorable stories. Yes, reviews are not always punctual, but 90% is a huge improvement.",UE
"I've always found Dropbox to be a bit faulty, but it's gotten worse since I upgraded to iOS 7. When I download zip files or web pages and open the files, the screen is blank, blackened, or a blurry enlarged image of the icon (from Facebook, Google, or other icons related to the page that the zip file or web page came from when I was a teacher), I rely on online & amp offline access to do research for my work as a teacher, and I need to write notes & amp as zip files to save space.",UE
"The only reason I switched to iOS7 was to get the latest version of Evernote. I have no idea what everyone is complaining about. Super easy to add notes still No sync issues Mobile phone announcements from Evernote The map indicator is still there, you just have to look (gasping) for a second.",UE
"Honestly, it took me a while to get used to the app - web clipping, photo notes, sharing, etc., but now I find that this app is the ""deal killer"" - the one thing that MUST be on any device - The note scanner is so powerful that it can read my scribbles (take notes in a meeting, take photos in evernote, throw them out!)",UE
"I never book a room without first checking the reviews on this page! I love how I can read reviews from ""real"" people and not what someone in marketing came up with to entice me to stay! I highly recommend it to everyone!",UE
"LOVE IT. From trips with the kids to experiencing new restaurants, I have saved a lot of money. I try to make use of the huge savings on massages and good ones.",UE
The best information about hotels!,UE
"I love that I can have Post-it notes without the post being his love, that I can take notes and jog a memory just by looking at the ""Post-it"" Good App, which I will update when I use up all the space)",UE
"I loved Evernotesthat is Until I download iOS7 With their new and improved look they also eliminated everything you had ever saved. However, they managed to keep the notebook names, unfortunately all the notes in these notebooks were deleted. I used this app for my work and all personal business files disappeared! Be sure to use this app only for unimportant notes Very disappointed - (",UE
"I love its multifunctionality. I am able to make several business and annual expenses, etc.!",UE
"It's great for my brother because he's only four years old, so when Disney comes I can play it for him so he's not on board.",UE
GudEs is a very good way to contact people far away,UE
Very helpful and informative for both countries and overseas,UE
There are so many cool choices??,UE
It allows me to take notes every day that help with medical evaluation. It almost feels like I am cheating my memory.,UE
Great app! Amazing features! Perfect for movie collectors. I love it!,UE
Fantastic app! Makes reading forums so much easier that I do it more now. Great!!,UE
"Love this app, although I wish you could add local stores to your store list",UE
"After downloading this, it just sat on my desktop for a million years. Then I came up with the brilliant idea of taking a screenshot of an Expedia itinerary Wow! Suddenly I'm running off, saving and retrieving information on everything from learning disabilities to salad dressings. I'd rather have layered nesting for the notebooks, but it's pretty cool by the way, I use the Skitch add-on for editing, reformatting, * bold * printing and so on. It's great",UE
I love this app because it helps me keep my finances in order.,UE
The best shoe app ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Correct dates and prices! Let me know everything about the shoe!??,UE
Tell me I was 31 when in 13 very sad app lowers self esteem lol don't get this app it is misleading and very inaccurate don't waste ur time,UE
The best replacement app if your laptop is broken!!,UE
Helpful in finding great lodging and restaurants from South Alabama to Arkansas to Texas,UE
"Mint is a great way to get control of your finances, it really helps you with your spending and makes you aware of what you are spending your money on.",UE
"I use it when we travel, I'd rather find places and read reviews that others have published that I visit, and then post my thoughts. So far, those who use and rate places are very fair and honest.",UE
The other reason I got the app is that it can be exported to QuickBooks even though I haven't used it yet. The reports are great. I'd love to have main categories and sub-categories. I think that's the only thing missing to make this app a really robust standalone financial management app. Keep it up!,UE
Extremely helpful in France We were only in restaurants rated by TA,UE
"I wanted an app that separates my videos from my photo archive. I wanted to be able to play my photo slideshow without interrupting annoying videos. Music stops and you have to start over. Now, the videos are on this app and I can play through all my images.",UE
"I have been using Evernote forfiver for a year now, very easy to use program, love syncing with my desktop, phone, iPad, etc.",UE

"Cross-platform access to your notes in the cloud is brilliant and a huge time saver! This app, combined with the inexpensive Bluetooth keyboard I recently purchased, has given me a powerful mobile ability to collect and organize information.",UE
"Notes app no longer required with all these features Between my Mac, iPhone and working with IE and desktop app, it's easy to save from the web and edit notes as needed",UE
"Well, I like it. That's right.",UE
"I've been using this for just over 6 weeks and have eliminated all paper notes. Even when I'm in a meeting without a laptop or iPad, my paper notes can be easily loaded by simply snapping a photo. In addition, classifying a note by notebook and adding tags makes it easy to spread them over a few different dimensions so they can be easily retrieved at a later date.",UE
"We always use this app because we are always looking for great restaurants. We don't cook a lot, so we make sure there is variety in the places we try. This app never disappoints!",UE
"Did not give 5 stars because not all campsites are listed. Sure is helpful although 99.5% of the time. Have used for gas, reservations for camp, restaurant locations, short distances. Great!",UE
"I've been working for TripAdvisor for many years. It's the first place I check when I go to a new area to get information about hotels, restaurants and activities, and the app on my iPad makes it easy for me to post reviews on the go.",UE
Great app for travelers. Highly recommended!,UE
Without this it is literally impossible to play music on my Xbox! Thank you! Happy Birthday??,UE

"Video Playback sucksThis is a wonderful app minus the videos To play one it takes you to an internet browser, then to youtube Please allow for in-app playback to bypass all the nonsense",UE
Easy to use Not driven by advertising Always full of things that interest me without chasing me or interrupting my enjoyment with endless advertising,UE
Who doesn't like a good deal now and then? Usually something for everyone and a simple user interface. Pretty thorough app.,UE
No more magazine clippings A place for to-do lists I'd love to see the ability to set alarms and send reminders One of my most popular and versatile apps,UE
"Love the app, use it all the time to check ship activity in Puget Sound. Helpful whether on land or on the water.",UE
"I started to use evernote since high school, but did not feel so useful Now I am college student, I use evernote in every life I love the highlights section, but wish there were more color than yellow In addition, I also like the website version It is organized and refined Thank you for providing this application It is so convenient",UE
"I have over 200 notes in Evernote (verified in the Mac version and on Evernotecom), but only 4 of them appeared in the new version of this app until I deleted them and re-installed Login and Login did not work The new interface will take some getting used to, but feels cleaner and faster than before",UE
"I must say that Evernote is in the top 3 ranking of my productivity apps, if not number 1. So easy to use, I use it to store all sorts of data that I can quickly remember Great for notes, recipes, software keys, wifi settings Endless applications",UE
"Used in the US, Ireland and continental Europe, good information such as location, numbers and website reviews are personal preferences, but knowledge of a majority opinion makes it easier to select locations and events.",UE
Easy-to-find venues Great to be steered to good places,UE
The reason I really like this app is that real people like me actually use the app and write the review. It's hard to blow smoke with so many of us using it now.,UE
Easy to use and very precise I always go to travel consultant to see opinions whether the good reviews are or not Thanks for the great app,UE
"This app is great, really puts your collection at your disposal! I really like how easy it is to manage your wine collection, buying, drinking or storing notes.",UE
"I started using travel consultants when my husband got a job traveling, and I went with him occasionally. We've been hooked ever since, and I've prevented my parents from finding local gems in restaurants and decent hotels. I love seeing the travel consultant's signs when I go to restaurants now. Anyone can be a critic.",UE
My husband and I always use a travel consultant before the holidays! So much useful information,UE
"This is a great app for planning a trip, if you want to go anywhere, definitely take advantage of this!! It helps me find restaurants in cities I've never visited, and great deals on flights and hotels",UE
This app made the search very easy and fast.,UE
Best appCan always edit my pictures and they will end well,UE
"The embellishment tool is a good example of this, as it may look good in the preview, but when you save it, you don't always get the same quality. Sometimes it turns out to be a bit pixelated, but overall it's a remarkable app! I use this in conjunction with other apps.",UE
"The best! I like the features, especially the stickers?",UE
Love! Best photo editor out there!,UE
"I use skritter to learn Japanese and it's an application that requires Flash, but I mainly study on my iPhone and probably wouldn't be able to keep up with the SRS if I could just run the program on my computer. Thanks to Splashtop I can now practice on the go. (That sounds like an infomercial lol)",UE
Dropbox works great I can access files anywhere Highly recommended,UE
Syncs well and wonderfully for projects at work and at home,UE

Love this appLets you keep all the things you find interesting in one place,UE
"I have been a P90X customer for some time and I love working out! With the P90X app, I now have the opportunity to do my workouts at the gym or when I travel with me. In addition, the nutrition diary makes it easier for me to keep track of what I eat during the day. It's a great app for me! Glad I bought this app!",UE
"I love this app. It's so easy to learn how to use it and it's very easy to understand. The only thing I don't like is that when you choose the option to show how the temperature feels, you can't see what the temperature actually is. I'd love to be able to see both at the same time.",UE
Beautiful display and lots of information instantly,UE
"After having tried many organizers over the past year, I have settled into Evernote. It is the easiest and most intuitive to use, synchronizes so easily with the laptop.",UE
"I tried Google Drive, Box, Skydrive, but none of them were able to upload a 20-minute video that I recorded with Dropbox. Dropbox was the only one that accepted my file.",UE
"I am really amazed at how well this app works.. the thing that strikes me most is the fact that when I record my voice for the translation, IT UNDERSTAND ME!! I have a very deep voice and I have never had any kind of software that was able to take what I said and convert it to the right version.. I am very, very satisfied with this app.. you should get it?",UE

"Great app, always works and is always on the spot!",UE
"I've used other note-taking apps before, but this is my favorite, I haven't even started scratching the surface of all its capabilities, but I love the fact that it can be synced across all my devices. My notes are easy to find. It would be great if there was a way to hide some of my notebooks with a password for secure data, which is the only reason I gave it four stars instead of five.",UE
This is a great tool for a quick laboratory consultation.,UE
This is an excellent app to use in the daily devout reading of the readings. Well done!,UE
"Live sky doesn't work via my touch. Also, I can't find my correct location. As close as the Droid app is to being... but turned off by parsec.",UE
"I've been using Google Drive for a few months, paid account - the desktop app was totally unreliable and couldn't sync all too often. So I returned to Dropbox, always syncing intelligently and reliablyA bit pricey though - almost twice as expensive as contests if you want the extra space",UE
"I've been waiting for this update, then we get this? EverNote is no longer for taking text notes It's obvious to me now, and I've been denying it for over a year. There's no font check, editing is random and flawed, slow as molasses and unreliable - if you take the time to write a paragraph, you want 100% confidence that EverNote won't crash halfway, or you'll get synchronization errors and lose your job. Note sorting and text-friendly organization (i.e. lists) have been thrown out the window because of a shiny user interface and lots of icons and eye-catching graphics. I can't write with the certainty that EverNote won't crash, but HEY, I can take a photo of my pancakes and keep it for posterity Hey, EverFail, I'm canceling my membership today if you take EverNote seriously as a tool for work, send me an email.",UE
"This is a great educational app for students, especially for the movies! It offers a great look for abstract content.",UE
This app is a good time. Fun at parties.,UE
Very easy to use on any device or operating system,UE

Especially the memory!,UE
"In fact, I think this app is absolutely brilliant when it comes to helping me prepare for my boards. However, just as the muscle name is indicated in the audio, I wish there was an option to hear all the information about the muscles in the audio.",UE
"I always use this app when we have travel plans as I rely on reviews to help us make travel decisions about where to stay, where to visit, etc.",UE
"This app has made my job and my life so much easier! It's available on all platforms and syncs automatically. There are constant updates that I've been using for about a year and I've never had a problem with losing notes. I use these to write my notes for billing, so this part is crucial. Thank you for making my life easier!!",UE
Love this app! Very precise. Quick response.,UE
"PerfectI love this app, I have it on all my devices and use it all the time for fun effects to get the perfect picture",UE

"I have used this program for over a year, now I use it for all my notes that no longer take pads! Easy to share information with employees with a few keystrokes A great app",UE
"This app is great for the newbie. I've just taken up a new position in my company that requires me to travel, and I always refer to Trip Advisor for reviews of hotels and good places to get a hot meal. I highly recommend this app!",UE
"The most amazing app, certainly the most used on my iPad, but I liked some features of the older version, please bring back the option to create paragraph headings and subsections. Typing might be faster, but still a great app.",UE
"We arrived at Dollar with a reservation at 2 p.m. plus the fast service I signed up for last week. It's been over an hour of queuing now. Hundreds of customers are queuing up, but very few counters are open. There's no seating and crying babies and disappointed families on every corner. Food is on the floor and the place is completely messed up. I'll never rent a garbage dump again. I'd rather walk. If I'd walked to Pasadena, I'd be almost there. Plus the staff is rude and ignorant. No pity for the customers who are standing in that endless line instead of spending Christmas with their families. My daughter and I flew in from New Jersey to visit my mother. Unfortunately, we've scheduled a full dinner tonight. Unfortunately, we're going to wait here in dollars for our pre-reserved rental car. The rush hour starts in 30 minutes, which will end any chance of seeing my family tonight. Shame on Dollar because she didn't properly fill her rental center during the crucial Christmas period.",UE

"I have been using EveryTrail.com for years - I love its ease of use and am looking to upload my tours and embed the maps into my blog. I used the free app for a long time until I had to find and download a way to use it offline during a recent trip. Enter EveryTrail Pro. This app has practically replaced my GPS device. I adjust the GPS settings to extend battery life, and I can go on epic tours and still have power to text photos of my friends from the trail.",UE

It's a fantastic way to keep track of your thoughts!,UE
"I've been using this app for over 8 months and is by far the best golf GPS for the money. I've ever had a Sky caddie, and he wasn't half as good as this app. Don't waste your money on any of the annual fee GPS units, buy this app and have everything you need. I have the iPhone 4 and only use about half the battery during a 4 1 / 2 to 5 1 / 2-hour round. Turn off your Wi-Fi if it needs more battery life than that.",UE

"This app is, in a word, blissfully serious, all I want and need to do, and all the ways I want to take notes - annotated and highlighted image clips, articles, news reports, etc. - in a beautifully bound package that helps to organize its like sticky notes, mole skin, pages, zotero and Instagram in one.",UE
"If you're mountain biking, hiking, camping or traveling, this is a must-have app! It now measures altitude, pace, speed and pretty much any other metric you need in any unit of measurement. That's by far the best app I have!",UE

This is a great app for a family on a bus,UE
"Love, this is the fall app",UE
I like the improvements of the user interface with the new version The old user interface was hideous and I used it normally via another app such as Drafts or IFTTT. But the fact that I can't add up-to-date photos from my album!?!?!? That for me is the main feature of Evernote That needs to be fixed!,UE
"Beautiful design update Looks great I love this Dropbox app has completely saved me at work I had to send a number of large files by email and the email system would not accept it Dropbox worked flawlessly Not only did they get links to download the files, but they were also able to view content directly in their web browser PDFs, Word documents and videos, all of which were visible to them in the browser It made presentations a breeze! I now use Dropbox for personal use too",UE
A very fun and easy way to keep up with your heart rate... also pretty precise!!!,UE
Good applications consume more phone memory,UE
"I am extremely excited about the possibilities to keep track of my brochures and clients in a user-friendly way with evernotes. Tag- and search-functions make it easy to call back prospective customers who are interested in certain models --new and used I can arrange the searches to see the latest entries first, which is very important in my business Many other applications work well, but I have an observation you should keep in mind There seems to be an error in the search function for notebooks when you perform a search in a particular notebook. Searching for all notebooks works well, as does the tag search. All in all, this is a great program.",UE
For a few days now. Easy to navigate and understand. Love it. Hope it stays free.,UE
"It's what it says it is, that's refreshing A place to gather all the information that can mess up your life Sure, it takes some work from you to sort it all out, but you've got to get it in one place first That's what Evernote does best It's on my iPhone, iPad and MacBook I use it every day",UE
"Thank you, thank you! It's fixed! I love Pinterest over all the other apps! I now know what it feels like to be dependent on something, but I really enjoy it! It's the easiest way to collect and organize interests and new ideas. It's almost too good to be a really great app! The only drawback I see is when I use Pinterest, time goes sooo fast I recommend this app & tell people who are looking for a specific pattern that I have that pattern on Pinterest!",UE

"No matter where I travel, it is very precise to use.",UE
"I use this app almost every weekend while exploring byways and trails by motorcycle. Functionality is excellent on the road, and I use the data to check it later with Google Earth. I've tried all the GPS tracking apps, and that's the one I return to every time. I strongly recommend reading the user guide and watching the videos. 10 minutes spent learning the app really pays off how much usage and functionality you get out of the app.",UE

"On a visit to the Philippines, I discovered TA when evaluating lodging options. Then I discovered all the related features, which included rich information about local restaurants and attractions. Yelp did not include anything in the Philippines. It is the strong international contribution of users (like me) that makes this app really good.",UE
"Excellent! Everything you need for ideas in one place. Much faster than searching the web, good job fellas!",UE
"I like the openness reflected in the reviews Some people like what I like and others don't. It's usually easy to adapt the review to the reviewer and get a good idea of whether the place and the person like the same things or not as I do. A good source of information for all ""excursions.""",UE
"When a brain tumor all but wiped out my short-term memory, I struggled in all areas of my life - including the work I do on my own, so I have to do my job at all times. Thank you Evernote! I am now regaining some confidence that what I am doing is right!",UE

"I use Dropbox for everything that is readily available on my phone, which has made checking updates of projects from work to sharing articles much easier when I'm not at the computer. Also, it makes it easy to get photos from phone to computer as I never seem to move them Shameless plus here - works great when combined with Ifttt to move captured things to calendar contacts via spreadsheet or special folders",UE
"So much fun! I love to pin projects, recipes and travel ideas, so I can get lost for hours.",UE
"Great AppFound my Canon MX880 printer. Worth it, because none of the other free applications worked to my liking.",UE

"You should select the folder first and then the files! I would put a folder as a favorite, so all the files within this as a favorite",UE
The graphics are superb and the user interface is very easy to use and navigate. Quiz options and the video are a great bonus feature. I am really happy (especially with the price) and look forward to trying the software of the other systems. Nice work!,UE

"I used this app to plan and manage an overseas trip. So far, Ben has weathered a few minor problems well. If I run it in the background on some modes, I think it provides location services where my battery seems to run out faster than usual. I'm not sure if that's it, or if I just use it more than normal. It would be great if there was a way to see my ""savings"" sorted by distance and a way to mark them as seen. Finally, if I use this during my trip, I really don't want to use international roaming to upload a review, but remember that I waited about 5 minutes later and they bother me again, so one star away for that.",UE
"At that moment, I thought I could transfer photos from my iPhone to my laptop faster via Dropbox than plugging my phone into the USB port.",UE

"/ / Update / / 149 laps logged. iPhone 3GS. Battery 70-80% after rounds left. Still no tracking of secondary games, but the notes function works a bit for that. Finally, five! Six! THE BEST APP FOR GOLF! 17 laps under my belt with this app now and still very happy. I'm blown away by the new in-app stats (v.1.3)! I'm still waiting for secondary games (skins, etc.). I'm baffled why so many golfers leave their phones on the entire round? I take mine off while I'm running to my ball, usually while I'm 20-30 yards away, I get positive satellite lock when I'm standing over the ball, reading my yard and falling asleep again. After flogging it, I can count the entire foursome (takes about 15 seconds in total) and then fall asleep again. I have consistently 80-85% battery life after my round is complete\ / I'll be happy to include a future game\ / GPS\ / even in a game!\ / I\ will be happy to update!",UE
"Convenient! No carrying your laptop or losing a USB flash drive anymore My files are always accessible from any of my devices or others.

I use my iPad to take notes for business meetings. It automatically syncs with my iPhone and laptop.,UE
"I love the search engine and the reviews (although I should read them before going out more often) I give my honest reviews the way I see them and am glad that people can take what I have to say and form their own opinions. I use the site a lot when I travel to find restaurants and accommodation, and some are local and some are not. Therefore, you have to make a personal decision.",UE
"I've been using Evernote since 2005 when I was in college. It's a wonderful service and until the iOS7 redesign, the apps always worked great, but the design of this app is terrible. It's confused, confusing and a lot of advertising for its service add-ons and ""news"" hinders the core functionality. Please revise the app again.",UE
I love being able to work with my phone or laptop. My family tree is always up to date.,UE
"Easy to use for quick, concise notation Would be fantastic if you could work freehand and if compatibility with wireless keyboards would be more efficient example Apple 'Command' key can not control bold underlined italics you still need to use screen",UE
A must for students or anyone who wants to improve their word power!,UE
"And the fact that people freak out about how real it is is the reason I give it a 5. It's based its answers on human responses, so it's very realistic but varies so much.",UE
"I used this for my holidays in Paris, Miami and Cape Cod, where I always find fun activities and good food.",UE
Love the user reviews and pictures,UE
"I've used it countless times now. It was handy, and when I use it, the other party is just as ""wowd"" as I was the first time. I gave it 4 stars because the speech is a bit quirky (it can be iPhone voice recognition problems) and because it's a translator who breaks down a sentence wittily, but when you type or talk like a caveman, it comes across every time.",UE
AddictionI love to pin the things that interest me and watch other people enjoy my attachment.,UE
I'm not sure how I've lived without them. It's best to keep all my important files in one place so I can access them from any device!,UE

"I really love this game, the game is amazing and for being a mobile game, the graphics are stunning.",UE
Love that you can save your stops on a trip for easy reference We really benefited from using Trip Advisor and facilitated the easy access that the app brings with it,UE
"Impressed by its versatility in terms of the type of note you can take It's great to have the ability to type URLs, photos, audio and text and great that it has desktop integration for a computerThe downside I've experienced is that it offers labels that it doesn't offer to edit folders and the dashboard in the app could use a simpler user interface.",UE
"Love the regular website and the app makes it twice as easy to find all your travel information! It's a great reference for travel planning, day trips or local exploration!",UE
I use it all the time I especially like the web clipper and then email directly from Evernote,UE

"Evernote is now practically useless I just tried to switch ticks on my shopping list yesterday, and it would take three or more attempts to confirm me, and then suddenly the keyboard would pop up for no reason and the screen and cursor would jump to the bottom of the list. When the program finally recognized me, the ticks were delayed by about 2 seconds each, as if it had to pause and sync between each gesture.",UE
This application was a lifesaver! It actually sinks by remote control with both my iPhone and my iPad. I love it!,UE
It is good and easy to use.,UE
Love the ability to post things the way I do,UE
Great app - nice layout But I wish saved articles could be viewed offline!,UE

"This app has gone so far for me On my iPod touch 4 generation I have done so much in such a short time Little more than 30 seconds it had created my account and uploaded pictures to there! Although I am busy with it, I trust that this will keep the apps of my and your Apple devices, music, photos, videos and so on safe with all your personal files.)",UE
I never have to take a foreign language course again!!,UE
I love the fact that Evernote allows me to synchronize my notes between each of my devices and computers that I use every day to keep everything right in front of me. I wish the interface was a bit different. Maybe the possibility of color notes?,UE
3 days is not enough. I need at least 5 days. Seems user-friendly and easy to follow. Maybe if it added the ingredients - not multiple entries for the one onion per se.,UE
"I use this app quite a lot to find restaurants and hotels, near and far And I contribute some Definitely worthwhile!",UE
From baby food and diaper changes to shopping lists and research - our family shares everything Thank you Evernote!!,UE

Great way to save! Thank you,UE
"The editability and consistency on the iPhone has improved with recent updates, and there is still work to be done to allow additional font sizes and the like for items created on the iPhone. However, if a 45 is given for this reason, it would be unfair to rate this with a 4 CC of these minor limitations.",UE
"I like that it gives you more information about the area. So I get more feedback, how is everyone's experience and there is more knowledge where and what to do.",UE
I love that this app takes less than ten seconds to tell you where your battery life is!!! I love it.,UE

"Since I signed up I've lost 10 pounds in 2 weeks, it's great",UE
"Great addition to the Angry Birds games. Great new features, challenges and visuals. If you're an Angry Birds fan, it's definitely worth it. The new ""Orbit"" launch is very neat and a nice, innovative twist on the game. It's definitely harder... at least in my opinion, which is a good thing.",UE
"It's a really good cloud app, but what sets it apart is the new pdf viewer! Now I can read huge files on the iPad. That's not possible with the Google Drive app",UE
Favourite hands for image editing? Easy to use Smart and up-to-date),UE
"This is a short Halloween story. There are several puzzles and a simple story that shows Mickey to whom friends will come later. My 2 1 / 2 year old will probably like it, but the 4 year old will get bored quickly. That's fine for a dollar.",UE
App works well for basic bank accounts.,UE
There is also hourly weather for the day!,UE
"This app is a must-have for professionals. It's a great way to stay ""green"" by saving documents rather than printing them out; the ability to browse notes and PDFs eliminates the need for old-fashioned pens and papers; and the integration with Penultimate is pleasing for those who still want to ""write"" rather than type.",UE
"Great interface that gathers so much information in one place, great app! Super intuitive to use.",UE
Great app! Very trustworthy and reliable! Always works as promised and provides useful information and travel tips!,UE

"Finally, an office suite that works great I went through so many office suites and tried to find the suites that best support the most common Microsoft Office suite applications. Finally, this suite fills 80% of these suites. If the font package were part of the suites, I would have awarded 95% and 5 stars.",UE
"Great! It's really easy to use and I love all the little icons to choose from. You can send videos and photos you don't need, Facebook or something like that, definitely download.)",UE
I loved it,UE
"I use this app all the time to keep track of notes, recipes, general information, favorite restaurants, etc. I organize something in advance, but the real advantage is that everything is searchable and available on my computer, phone and tablet. Excellent and useful!",UE
"As stated in the title, I am a new user Although I have only been using Evernote for about two months, I have become very dependent on it. It is great to be able to record a meeting and take notes at the same time. I can't think of anything better, I hope to find out all the other ways to use it!",UE
I love Evernote and have been using it for a couple of years. Good for fast word processing and keeping track of all sorts of things I use as my daily diary!,UE
My family travels all the time and this app has been a lifesaver countless times! I use it now for everything)! Highly recommended!!!,UE
"Capturing signatures is a huge time saver. Think about how you insert your contact information from your email into your contacts, just copy your signature into this app, it will split into different fields and insert it into your iPhone contacts. How great!",UE
A real life saver and eye-opener for this iPad newcomer. I learned so much from this app. The information is well written and easy to understand. I just wish my brain could keep everything for an instant recall!,UE

"I've been using Advisor for years, and it seems like I'm about to give it a rating, with such a wide variety of focus areas like restaurants, hotels and attractions, and a huge user base that exponentially adds value to the app.",UE
"I can't leave the house without finally downloading the app to my phone, which I used to only use with my computer. I'm now planning my entire trip to Key West with a travel consultant. Thank you.",UE

Love this app. You decide how you want your collage. You should add more different frames.,UE

"Great app that I used regularly, but since the iOS 7 update and the update of the app itself seems a bit jerky.",UE
"I have to say, on the whole, I like this app, although the logic behind the 15-minute limit on streaming alludes to me that I thought they imposed it to reduce bandwidth, but with the limit it actually increases bandwidth. The reason for this is that I download the whole file and then start streaming as soon as the 15 minutes have expired, I then switch to the downloaded file.",UE
It was so useful to chat and chat me up with all frndsI love these wats up and I enjoy the days chatting with my frnds tks for this innovative idea hats off,UE

A wonderful substitute for the loss of brain function in middle age.,UE
"I own a limousine company and all my drivers use it to track their customers ""flights.",UE
"I find most of the music I like, and I can play anywhere I go...",UE
"This app is so fantastic that I find it even better than the website. It's easy to navigate, easy to change and change reservations. There's the option to insert it into your calendar, and it puts all the information directly into your phone calendar. You can just invite your guests via the app (it creates an email for you). A big part of it is that you can only filter your search by 1000 point tables, by neighbourhood, by distance to you and so much more. I use this app regularly - so much so that I'm going to make a reservation that we've just decided to make it easier when we get there! It's such a great app (and the store) that I always wonder why some restaurants don't have it!",UE
Beautiful and smooth photo streaming from device to device,UE

I love having travel advisors on my iPhone and iPad - I discovered the cunning point where I have feature Awesome for us directionally challenged people,UE
Cooooool App??????,UE
"Great app, huge selection of titles and great free section with many bi-monthly / monthly releases. The only problem is that the viewer hangs up occasionally but not often and a reboot of the app usually helps. Overall, one of the best apps in the entire app store.",UE
"I use evernote for most of my notes, but now I have to pay $5 a month just for a slightly longer note? Ridiculous!",UE

When my Weight Watchers membership expires, I'll continue to monitor my food intake with Lose It! In the meantime, I'm monitoring my progress with both apps so the transition is smooth. So far, I've found that Lose It! is much faster and easier to use.",UE

Very helpful for the home nurse on site.,UE
"Great app!! This made life easy, capturing family moments and saving for years to come I rated pretty few and Evernote are at the top of the list",UE
"This app is really useful for accessing documents while I'm out and about The only big thing I think it lacks is a way to share folders while you're using the app I'd love to be able to share a folder through the app, and I had to do this before while I was out and about, but unfortunately this app as of 3113 doesn't have this feature It would be really useful to have it!",UE
It's great how you can review an area and save the things you want to do in that area for your next visit.,UE
Love itIve never had problems uploads and searches are fine,UE
Error reportNot OK,UE
Finally. A safe place for my private photos. No more worrying about things being seen accidentally. Buy this.,UE

Excellent!!!! Love love love love!!!! I have so many new recipes and design ideas It is so much fun to see what friends like and pin also,UE
"Now that I have this app, I can't imagine how I got on without it. In my experience, it's about 98% accurate and the spoken directions are a necessity if you're traveling alone. An improvement would be to have the spoken directions a little earlier, especially on a busy highway. I would recommend this app to anyone looking for a reliable, accurate directions.",UE
The best thing I've ever tried??? It??? s been up for a long time.???,UE
"I think this app works better than using my desktop forums. Eat fast to read, search well. I wish it had miniusa and bike forums... Ideal for Tacoma World.",UE
"Some cards are super funny! They are a great way to make someone laugh. Sometimes, I just like to look through them because they are fun to read.",UE
I love it I can pin what I like and send pictures and quotes to my girlfriend,UE
"Good thing is you need people's contacts to get them on whatsapp, but that's the only bad thing about it",UE
"A great app at hand. The pronunciation button is a useful tool if you're not sure if a word is pronounced correctly. Also, several definitions are given to ensure that you use the word in its true context.",UE
"Synchronizing is a bit difficult at first glance, but otherwise wonderful.",UE
My favorite app. It really works! You have to try it.,UE
"EVERY FIRST OF ALL RECEIVES THIS APP IF YOU HAVE A FANTASY TEAM AND CAN ACT YES. CHOOSE THE TEAM, YOU WANT TO ACT WITH AND THEN THE PRESS PROPOSE TRADE TO THE TOP OF THE SCREW!!!!!!",UE
It is a pure pleasure to have a photo when your friends call and sometimes contact information from your FB friends that you did not take the time to acquire. Fabulous!,UE
The new PDF-Reader is GREAT!!,UE
"I use it every time I'm out of time for restaurants and have never done anything wrong. I've tried other food apps that aren't nearly as accurate. A plus is that they don't mess with the ratings of fast food restaurants. Who needs a star rating for McDonalds, Burger King, etc.? Also very good to find a good hotel.",UE
This app works like a charm. You don't have to spend the extra time finding an available partner.,UE
"This has become my most important note-taking program. I wish I could write handwriting on it. Love, how can I store Outlook emails in it?",UE
"Very helpful to have it, but why some reviews aren't published here, I wrote negatively about the Best West Myrtle Beach hotel they don't want to publish. I hope this isn't like a BBB agency paying money to get good reviews.",UE
"I already gave a review when I first downloaded that this app is the best. Well, yesterday it proved to be the best. I have a health condition and yesterday I had to go to the hospital. I just emailed my list, printed it out and could give it to the doctor. Even the nurses and doctors were impressed. However, there is one thing I think would make this app even better. Add a COMMENTS section so you can write comments about yourself or the medication or whatever.",UE
It's a great app for taking notes for lessons on my tablet and still being able to access it over the internet.,UE
Really like this app. It's a very simple way to diary,UE
I find this app very useful. It has mechanisms and class information that most other free programs lack. It can't be done much better (especially for free)!,UE
"Green UI doesn't look good or feel good It's also no useful place to maximize space should be the goal, but it doesn't feel like it The app still works It's clunky and too much advertising Probably it's not even a problem that they've rolled out the ads at the wrong time",UE
I like this app and how I can place articles that I want to review at a later time. I use it to store recipes or interesting articles that I can read at a later time.,UE
"If the stars could be higher, I would rate them as that. I want to become an orthopedic surgeon and this is the best app I've ever come across to learn the skeletal system!!! I would recommend it to anyone, from a surgical intern to an A & P student in high school! Best thing, I can't say it enough!",UE
"I use it to track recipes, take notes on hobbies, keep up with maintenance.",UE
So easy to use!,UE
Absolutely handy for the pictures you don't have to see otherwise.,UE
This app is great for road trips. Children can listen to their music and I can put on headphones and listen to my books.,UE
Exactly the biggest thing I love is that I can spend hours and hours on it! There's nothing I don't like!,UE
"It takes forever to upload photos, 2-3 weeks after I started the photos, it was finally visible. I had no problems installing the latest update. I love the recent upgrades.",UE
Addictive! Love to save things to read them later and find so many clever ideas!!,UE
"Love this app on my iPhone, iPad and computer you all sync Nice Use it on the go to look up restaurants and use it to research all our trips The reviews and forums are great tools for travel",UE
"Love, this saves me having to turn on the light via settings. I use it all the time.",UE
"PC, laptops, droids, tablets, two iPhones and a number of reference documents on all for me and the woman What the hell have I done by sending copies and updates in msgs and handwritten notes, I am so embarrassed that I did not find that 3 years ago?",UE
"As a writing daydreamer, I'm constantly thinking about new ideas, and having a tool to access my material wherever I go is fantastic. Instead of just writing down a note (which I can't always do) and pointing it out later when I get home, logging on to the computer and opening a Word document, it's so much easier and more convenient to do it with this app that I've even used Evernote for school work, essays most of the time, so there's no need to send me documents by email. There are just a few mistakes that I noticed, but nothing that makes me stop using this app, I love it too much!!",UE
"It is as accurate as any weather forecaster paid to get it 100% wrong. So far, this app has been close enough to allow me to dress appropriately, so too much scientific input is important to me. I just don't want to carry an umbrella when the sun is shining.",UE
"I love this app, super simple interface and I use it all the time.",UE
"Very useful, but sometimes it's difficult to type an essay without cross-sectional mode. It's ridiculous how a word-processing app can't type landscape.",UE
Only the required link Perfect solution for my Android / Linux environment. Works well with Tasker.,UE
"Very useful app, have fun looking and seeing what is available.",UE
I used this app recently during Hurricane Isaac. This app was updated faster and was much more reliable than the other two with the big websites. Get it. You may need it when it matters.,UE
Beautiful user interface Keep up the good work!,UE
"great item. Quick, easy ordering. Love fab.",UE
"I have now traveled through the US and several European countries and do not know how I have traveled without it. It has lost sight of the risk of invisible hotels and restaurants and led to many memorable stories. Yes, reviews are not always punctual, but 90% is a huge improvement.",UE
"I've always found Dropbox to be a bit faulty, but it's gotten worse since I upgraded to iOS 7. When I download zip files or web pages and open the files, the screen is blank, blackened, or a blurry enlarged image of the icon (from Facebook, Google, or other icons related to the page that the zip file or web page came from when I was a teacher), I rely on online & amp offline access to do research for my work as a teacher, and I need to write notes & amp as zip files to save space.",UE
"The only reason I switched to iOS7 was to get the latest version of Evernote. I have no idea what everyone is complaining about. Super easy to add notes still No sync issues Mobile phone announcements from Evernote The map indicator is still there, you just have to look (gasping) for a second.",UE
"Honestly, it took me a while to get used to the app - web clipping, photo notes, sharing, etc., but now I find that this app is the ""deal killer"" - the one thing that MUST be on any device - The note scanner is so powerful that it can read my scribbles (take notes in a meeting, take photos in evernote, throw them out!)",UE
"I never book a room without first checking the reviews on this page! I love how I can read reviews from ""real"" people and not what someone in marketing came up with to entice me to stay! I highly recommend it to everyone!",UE
"LOVE IT. From trips with the kids to experiencing new restaurants, I have saved a lot of money. I try to make use of the huge savings on massages and good ones.",UE
The best information about hotels!,UE
"I love that I can have Post-it notes without the post being his love, that I can take notes and jog a memory just by looking at the ""Post-it"" Good App, which I will update when I use up all the space)",UE
"I loved Evernotesthat is Until I download iOS7 With their new and improved look they also eliminated everything you had ever saved. However, they managed to keep the notebook names, unfortunately all the notes in these notebooks were deleted. I used this app for my work and all personal business files disappeared! Be sure to use this app only for unimportant notes Very disappointed - (",UE
"I love its multifunctionality. I am able to make several business and annual expenses, etc.!",UE
"It's great for my brother because he's only four years old, so when Disney comes I can play it for him so he's not on board.",UE
GudEs is a very good way to contact people far away,UE
Very helpful and informative for both countries and overseas,UE
There are so many cool choices??,UE

Fantastic app! Makes reading forums so much easier that I do it more now. Great!!,UE
"Love this app, although I wish you could add local stores to your store list",UE
"After downloading this, it just sat on my desktop for a million years. Then I came up with the brilliant idea of taking a screenshot of an Expedia itinerary Wow! Suddenly I'm running off, saving and retrieving information on everything from learning disabilities to salad dressings. I'd rather have layered nesting for the notebooks, but it's pretty cool by the way, I use the Skitch add-on for editing, reformatting, * bold * printing and so on. It's great",UE
I love this app because it helps me keep my finances in order.,UE
The best shoe app ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Correct dates and prices! Let me know everything about the shoe!??,UE

The best replacement app if your laptop is broken!!,UE
Helpful in finding great lodging and restaurants from South Alabama to Arkansas to Texas,UE
"Mint is a great way to get control of your finances, it really helps you with your spending and makes you aware of what you are spending your money on.",UE
"I use it when we travel, I'd rather find places and read reviews that others have published that I visit, and then post my thoughts. So far, those who use and rate places are very fair and honest.",UE
The other reason I got the app is that it can be exported to QuickBooks even though I haven't used it yet. The reports are great. I'd love to have main categories and sub-categories. I think that's the only thing missing to make this app a really robust standalone financial management app. Keep it up!,UE
Extremely helpful in France We were only in restaurants rated by TA,UE
"I wanted an app that separates my videos from my photo archive. I wanted to be able to play my photo slideshow without interrupting annoying videos. Music stops and you have to start over. Now, the videos are on this app and I can play through all my images.",UE

"Cross-platform access to your notes in the cloud is brilliant and a huge time saver! This app, combined with the inexpensive Bluetooth keyboard I recently purchased, has given me a powerful mobile ability to collect and organize information.",UE
"Notes app no longer required with all these features Between my Mac, iPhone and working with IE and desktop app, it's easy to save from the web and edit notes as needed",UE
"Well, I like it. That's right.",UE
"I've been using this for just over 6 weeks and have eliminated all paper notes. Even when I'm in a meeting without a laptop or iPad, my paper notes can be easily loaded by simply snapping a photo. In addition, classifying a note by notebook and adding tags makes it easy to spread them over a few different dimensions so they can be easily retrieved at a later date.",UE
"We always use this app because we are always looking for great restaurants. We don't cook a lot, so we make sure there is variety in the places we try. This app never disappoints!",UE
"Did not give 5 stars because not all campsites are listed. Sure is helpful although 99.5% of the time. Have used for gas, reservations for camp, restaurant locations, short distances. Great!",UE

"Video Playback sucksThis is a wonderful app minus the videos To play one it takes you to an internet browser, then to youtube Please allow for in-app playback to bypass all the nonsense",UE
Easy to use Not driven by advertising Always full of things that interest me without chasing me or interrupting my enjoyment with endless advertising,UE
Who doesn't like a good deal now and then? Usually something for everyone and a simple user interface. Pretty thorough app.,UE
No more magazine clippings A place for to-do lists I'd love to see the ability to set alarms and send reminders One of my most popular and versatile apps,UE

"I started to use evernote since high school, but did not feel so useful Now I am college student, I use evernote in every life I love the highlights section, but wish there were more color than yellow In addition, I also like the website version It is organized and refined Thank you for providing this application It is so convenient",UE
"I have over 200 notes in Evernote (verified in the Mac version and on Evernotecom), but only 4 of them appeared in the new version of this app until I deleted them and re-installed Login and Login did not work The new interface will take some getting used to, but feels cleaner and faster than before",UE
"I must say that Evernote is in the top 3 ranking of my productivity apps, if not number 1. So easy to use, I use it to store all sorts of data that I can quickly remember Great for notes, recipes, software keys, wifi settings Endless applications",UE
"Used in the US, Ireland and continental Europe, good information such as location, numbers and website reviews are personal preferences, but knowledge of a majority opinion makes it easier to select locations and events.",UE
Easy-to-find venues Great to be steered to good places,UE
The reason I really like this app is that real people like me actually use the app and write the review. It's hard to blow smoke with so many of us using it now.,UE

"This app is great, really puts your collection at your disposal! I really like how easy it is to manage your wine collection, buying, drinking or storing notes.",UE
"I started using travel consultants when my husband got a job traveling, and I went with him occasionally. We've been hooked ever since, and I've prevented my parents from finding local gems in restaurants and decent hotels. I love seeing the travel consultant's signs when I go to restaurants now. Anyone can be a critic.",UE
My husband and I always use a travel consultant before the holidays! So much useful information,UE
"This is a great app for planning a trip, if you want to go anywhere, definitely take advantage of this!! It helps me find restaurants in cities I've never visited, and great deals on flights and hotels",UE
This app made the search very easy and fast.,UE
Best appCan always edit my pictures and they will end well,UE
"The embellishment tool is a good example of this, as it may look good in the preview, but when you save it, you don't always get the same quality. Sometimes it turns out to be a bit pixelated, but overall it's a remarkable app! I use this in conjunction with other apps.",UE
"The best! I like the features, especially the stickers?",UE
Love! Best photo editor out there!,UE
"I use skritter to learn Japanese and it's an application that requires Flash, but I mainly study on my iPhone and probably wouldn't be able to keep up with the SRS if I could just run the program on my computer. Thanks to Splashtop I can now practice on the go. (That sounds like an infomercial lol)",UE
Dropbox works great I can access files anywhere Highly recommended,UE
Syncs well and wonderfully for projects at work and at home,UE

"I have been a P90X customer for some time and I love working out! With the P90X app, I now have the opportunity to do my workouts at the gym or when I travel with me. In addition, the nutrition diary makes it easier for me to keep track of what I eat during the day. It's a great app for me! Glad I bought this app!",UE
"I love this app. It's so easy to learn how to use it and it's very easy to understand. The only thing I don't like is that when you choose the option to show how the temperature feels, you can't see what the temperature actually is. I'd love to be able to see both at the same time.",UE
Beautiful display and lots of information instantly,UE
"After having tried many organizers over the past year, I have settled into Evernote. It is the easiest and most intuitive to use, synchronizes so easily with the laptop.",UE
"I tried Google Drive, Box, Skydrive, but none of them were able to upload a 20-minute video that I recorded with Dropbox. Dropbox was the only one that accepted my file.",UE

"I've used other note-taking apps before, but this is my favorite, I haven't even started scratching the surface of all its capabilities, but I love the fact that it can be synced across all my devices. My notes are easy to find. It would be great if there was a way to hide some of my notebooks with a password for secure data, which is the only reason I gave it four stars instead of five.",UE
This is a great tool for a quick laboratory consultation.,UE
This is an excellent app to use in the daily devout reading of the readings. Well done!,UE
"Live sky doesn't work via my touch. Also, I can't find my correct location. As close as the Droid app is to being... but turned off by parsec.",UE
"I've been using Google Drive for a few months, paid account - the desktop app was totally unreliable and couldn't sync all too often. So I returned to Dropbox, always syncing intelligently and reliablyA bit pricey though - almost twice as expensive as contests if you want the extra space",UE
"I've been waiting for this update, then we get this? EverNote is no longer for taking text notes It's obvious to me now, and I've been denying it for over a year. There's no font check, editing is random and flawed, slow as molasses and unreliable - if you take the time to write a paragraph, you want 100% confidence that EverNote won't crash halfway, or you'll get synchronization errors and lose your job. Note sorting and text-friendly organization (i.e. lists) have been thrown out the window because of a shiny user interface and lots of icons and eye-catching graphics. I can't write with the certainty that EverNote won't crash, but HEY, I can take a photo of my pancakes and keep it for posterity Hey, EverFail, I'm canceling my membership today if you take EverNote seriously as a tool for work, send me an email.",UE

"The most amazing app, certainly the most used on my iPad, but I liked some features of the older version, please bring back the option to create paragraph headings and subsections. Typing might be faster, but still a great app.",UE
"We arrived at Dollar with a reservation at 2 p.m. plus the fast service I signed up for last week. It's been over an hour of queuing now. Hundreds of customers are queuing up, but very few counters are open. There's no seating and crying babies and disappointed families on every corner. Food is on the floor and the place is completely messed up. I'll never rent a garbage dump again. I'd rather walk. If I'd walked to Pasadena, I'd be almost there. Plus the staff is rude and ignorant. No pity for the customers who are standing in that endless line instead of spending Christmas with their families. My daughter and I flew in from New Jersey to visit my mother. Unfortunately, we've scheduled a full dinner tonight. Unfortunately, we're going to wait here in dollars for our pre-reserved rental car. The rush hour starts in 30 minutes, which will end any chance of seeing my family tonight. Shame on Dollar because she didn't properly fill her rental center during the crucial Christmas period.",UE
It has some really cool and interesting tattoos,UE

I used the free app for a long time until I had to find and download a way to use it offline during a recent trip. Enter EveryTrail Pro. This app has practically replaced my GPS device.

It's a fantastic way to keep track of your thoughts!,UE
"I've been using this app for over 8 months and is by far the best golf GPS for the money. I've ever had a Sky caddie, and he wasn't half as good as this app. Don't waste your money on any of the annual fee GPS units, buy this app and have everything you need. I have the iPhone 4 and only use about half the battery during a 4 1 / 2 to 5 1 / 2-hour round. Turn off your Wi-Fi if it needs more battery life than that.",UE
Excellent WebsiteNothing can go wrong here! But don't join in if you don't have a few hours every day to kill addictive substances!,UE

"This app is, in a word, blissfully serious, all I want and need to do, and all the ways I want to take notes - annotated and highlighted image clips, articles, news reports, etc. - in a beautifully bound package that helps to organize its like sticky notes, mole skin, pages, zotero and Instagram in one.",UE
"If you're mountain biking, hiking, camping or traveling, this is a must-have app! It now measures altitude, pace, speed and pretty much any other metric you need in any unit of measurement. That's by far the best app I have!",UE

This is a great app for a family on a bus,UE
"Love, this is the fall app",UE
I like the improvements of the user interface with the new version The old user interface was hideous and I used it normally via another app such as Drafts or IFTTT. But the fact that I can't add up-to-date photos from my album!?!?!? That for me is the main feature of Evernote That needs to be fixed!,UE
"Beautiful design update Looks great I love this Dropbox app has completely saved me at work I had to send a number of large files by email and the email system would not accept it Dropbox worked flawlessly Not only did they get links to download the files, but they were also able to view content directly in their web browser PDFs, Word documents and videos, all of which were visible to them in the browser It made presentations a breeze! I now use Dropbox for personal use too",UE
A very fun and easy way to keep up with your heart rate... also pretty precise!!!,UE
Good applications consume more phone memory,UE
"I am extremely excited about the possibilities to keep track of my brochures and clients in a user-friendly way with evernotes. Tag- and search-functions make it easy to call back prospective customers who are interested in certain models --new and used I can arrange the searches to see the latest entries first, which is very important in my business Many other applications work well, but I have an observation you should keep in mind There seems to be an error in the search function for notebooks when you perform a search in a particular notebook. Searching for all notebooks works well, as does the tag search. All in all, this is a great program.",UE
For a few days now. Easy to navigate and understand. Love it. Hope it stays free.,UE
"It's what it says it is, that's refreshing A place to gather all the information that can mess up your life Sure, it takes some work from you to sort it all out, but you've got to get it in one place first That's what Evernote does best It's on my iPhone, iPad and MacBook I use it every day",UE
"Thank you, thank you! It's fixed! I love Pinterest over all the other apps! I now know what it feels like to be dependent on something, but I really enjoy it! It's the easiest way to collect and organize interests and new ideas. It's almost too good to be a really great app! The only drawback I see is when I use Pinterest, time goes sooo fast I recommend this app & tell people who are looking for a specific pattern that I have that pattern on Pinterest!",UE

"No matter where I travel, it is very precise to use.",UE
"I use this app almost every weekend while exploring byways and trails by motorcycle. Functionality is excellent on the road, and I use the data to check it later with Google Earth. I've tried all the GPS tracking apps, and that's the one I return to every time. I strongly recommend reading the user guide and watching the videos. 10 minutes spent learning the app really pays off how much usage and functionality you get out of the app.",UE

"On a visit to the Philippines, I discovered TA when evaluating lodging options. Then I discovered all the related features, which included rich information about local restaurants and attractions. Yelp did not include anything in the Philippines. It is the strong international contribution of users (like me) that makes this app really good.",UE
"Excellent! Everything you need for ideas in one place. Much faster than searching the web, good job fellas!",UE
"I like the openness reflected in the reviews Some people like what I like and others don't. It's usually easy to adapt the review to the reviewer and get a good idea of whether the place and the person like the same things or not as I do. A good source of information for all ""excursions.""",UE
"When a brain tumor all but wiped out my short-term memory, I struggled in all areas of my life - including the work I do on my own, so I have to do my job at all times. Thank you Evernote! I am now regaining some confidence that what I am doing is right!",UE

Great horrible photo editor out there,UE
Great tool to consolidate your notes,UE

"I use Dropbox for everything that is readily available on my phone, which has made checking updates of projects from work to sharing articles much easier when I'm not at the computer. Also, it makes it easy to get photos from phone to computer as I never seem to move them Shameless plus here - works great when combined with Ifttt to move captured things to calendar contacts via spreadsheet or special folders",UE
"So much fun! I love to pin projects, recipes and travel ideas, so I can get lost for hours.",UE
"Great AppFound my Canon MX880 printer. Worth it, because none of the other free applications worked to my liking.",UE

"You should select the folder first and then the files! I would put a folder as a favorite, so all the files within this as a favorite",UE
The graphics are superb and the user interface is very easy to use and navigate. Quiz options and the video are a great bonus feature. I am really happy (especially with the price) and look forward to trying the software of the other systems. Nice work!,UE

The best app ever made for busy people stays with everything and is a great app for people with jobs and hobbies that take up your time,UE

"I used this app to plan and manage an overseas trip. So far, Ben has weathered a few minor problems well. If I run it in the background on some modes, I think it provides location services where my battery seems to run out faster than usual. I'm not sure if that's it, or if I just use it more than normal. It would be great if there was a way to see my ""savings"" sorted by distance and a way to mark them as seen. Finally, if I use this during my trip, I really don't want to use international roaming to upload a review, but remember that I waited about 5 minutes later and they bother me again, so one star away for that.",UE
"At that moment, I thought I could transfer photos from my iPhone to my laptop faster via Dropbox than plugging my phone into the USB port.",UE

"/ / Update / / 149 laps logged. iPhone 3GS. Battery 70-80% after rounds left. Still no tracking of secondary games, but the notes function works a bit for that. Finally, five! Six! THE BEST APP FOR GOLF! 17 laps under my belt with this app now and still very happy. I'm blown away by the new in-app stats (v.1.3)! I'm still waiting for secondary games (skins, etc.). I'm baffled why so many golfers leave their phones on the entire round? I take mine off while I'm running to my ball, usually while I'm 20-30 yards away, I get positive satellite lock when I'm standing over the ball, reading my yard and falling asleep again. After flogging it, I can count the entire foursome (takes about 15 seconds in total) and then fall asleep again. I have consistently 80-85% battery life after my round is complete\ / I'll be happy to include a future game\ / GPS\ / even in a game!\ / I\ will be happy to update!",UE

I use my iPad to take notes for business meetings. It automatically syncs with my iPhone and laptop.,UE
"I love the search engine and the reviews (although I should read them before going out more often) I give my honest reviews the way I see them and am glad that people can take what I have to say and form their own opinions. I use the site a lot when I travel to find restaurants and accommodation, and some are local and some are not. Therefore, you have to make a personal decision.",UE
"I've been using Evernote since 2005 when I was in college. It's a wonderful service and until the iOS7 redesign, the apps always worked great, but the design of this app is terrible. It's confused, confusing and a lot of advertising for its service add-ons and ""news"" hinders the core functionality. Please revise the app again.",UE
I love being able to work with my phone or laptop. My family tree is always up to date.,UE
"Easy to use for quick, concise notation Would be fantastic if you could work freehand and if compatibility with wireless keyboards would be more efficient example Apple 'Command' key can not control bold underlined italics you still need to use screen",UE
A must for students or anyone who wants to improve their word power!,UE
"And the fact that people freak out about how real it is is the reason I give it a 5. It's based its answers on human responses, so it's very realistic but varies so much.",UE
"I used this for my holidays in Paris, Miami and Cape Cod, where I always find fun activities and good food.",UE
Love the user reviews and pictures,UE
"I've used it countless times now. It was handy, and when I use it, the other party is just as ""wowd"" as I was the first time. I gave it 4 stars because the speech is a bit quirky (it can be iPhone voice recognition problems) and because it's a translator who breaks down a sentence wittily, but when you type or talk like a caveman, it comes across every time.",UE
AddictionI love to pin the things that interest me and watch other people enjoy my attachment.,UE
I'm not sure how I've lived without them. It's best to keep all my important files in one place so I can access them from any device!,UE

"I really love this game, the game is amazing and for being a mobile game, the graphics are stunning.",UE
Love that you can save your stops on a trip for easy reference We really benefited from using Trip Advisor and facilitated the easy access that the app brings with it,UE
"Impressed by its versatility in terms of the type of note you can take It's great to have the ability to type URLs, photos, audio and text and great that it has desktop integration for a computerThe downside I've experienced is that it offers labels that it doesn't offer to edit folders and the dashboard in the app could use a simpler user interface.",UE
"Love the regular website and the app makes it twice as easy to find all your travel information! It's a great reference for travel planning, day trips or local exploration!",UE
I use it all the time I especially like the web clipper and then email directly from Evernote,UE

"Evernote is now practically useless I just tried to switch ticks on my shopping list yesterday, and it would take three or more attempts to confirm me, and then suddenly the keyboard would pop up for no reason and the screen and cursor would jump to the bottom of the list. When the program finally recognized me, the ticks were delayed by about 2 seconds each, as if it had to pause and sync between each gesture.",UE
This application was a lifesaver! It actually sinks by remote control with both my iPhone and my iPad. I love it!,UE
It is good and easy to use.,UE
Love the ability to post things the way I do,UE
Great app - nice layout But I wish saved articles could be viewed offline!,UE

"This app has gone so far for me On my iPod touch 4 generation I have done so much in such a short time Little more than 30 seconds it had created my account and uploaded pictures to there! Although I am busy with it, I trust that this will keep the apps of my and your Apple devices, music, photos, videos and so on safe with all your personal files.)",UE
I never have to take a foreign language course again!!,UE
I love the fact that Evernote allows me to synchronize my notes between each of my devices and computers that I use every day to keep everything right in front of me. I wish the interface was a bit different. Maybe the possibility of color notes?,UE
3 days is not enough. I need at least 5 days. Seems user-friendly and easy to follow. Maybe if it added the ingredients - not multiple entries for the one onion per se.,UE
"I use this app quite a lot to find restaurants and hotels, near and far And I contribute some Definitely worthwhile!",UE
From baby food and diaper changes to shopping lists and research - our family shares everything Thank you Evernote!!,UE

Great way to save! Thank you,UE
"The editability and consistency on the iPhone has improved with recent updates, and there is still work to be done to allow additional font sizes and the like for items created on the iPhone. However, if a 45 is given for this reason, it would be unfair to rate this with a 4 CC of these minor limitations.",UE
"I like that it gives you more information about the area. So I get more feedback, how is everyone's experience and there is more knowledge where and what to do.",UE
I love that this app takes less than ten seconds to tell you where your battery life is!!! I love it.,UE

It is worth it. Great tool for checking and spontaneous reference of the moment.,UE

"Great addition to the Angry Birds games. Great new features, challenges and visuals. If you're an Angry Birds fan, it's definitely worth it. The new ""Orbit"" launch is very neat and a nice, innovative twist on the game. It's definitely harder... at least in my opinion, which is a good thing.",UE

App works well for basic bank accounts.,UE
There is also hourly weather for the day!,UE
"This app is a must-have for professionals. It's a great way to stay ""green"" by saving documents rather than printing them out; the ability to browse notes and PDFs eliminates the need for old-fashioned pens and papers; and the integration with Penultimate is pleasing for those who still want to ""write"" rather than type.",UE
"Great interface that gathers so much information in one place, great app! Super intuitive to use.",UE

"Finally, an office suite that works great I went through so many office suites and tried to find the suites that best support the most common Microsoft Office suite applications.

"As stated in the title, I am a new user Although I have only been using Evernote for about two months, I have become very dependent on it.

"Great app that I used regularly, but since the iOS 7 update and the update of the app itself seems a bit jerky.",UE
"I have to say, on the whole, I like this app, although the logic behind the 15-minute limit on streaming alludes to me that I thought they imposed it to reduce bandwidth, but with the limit it actually increases bandwidth. The reason for this is that I download the whole file and then start streaming as soon as the 15 minutes have expired, I then switch to the downloaded file.",UE
It was so useful to chat and chat me up with all frndsI love these wats up and I enjoy the days chatting with my frnds tks for this innovative idea hats off,UE

A wonderful substitute for the loss of brain function in middle age.,UE
"I own a limousine company and all my drivers use it to track their customers ""flights.",UE
"I find most of the music I like, and I can play anywhere I go...",UE
"This app is so fantastic that I find it even better than the website. It's easy to navigate, easy to change and change reservations. There's the option to insert it into your calendar, and it puts all the information directly into your phone calendar. You can just invite your guests via the app (it creates an email for you). A big part of it is that you can only filter your search by 1000 point tables, by neighbourhood, by distance to you and so much more. I use this app regularly - so much so that I'm going to make a reservation that we've just decided to make it easier when we get there! It's such a great app (and the store) that I always wonder why some restaurants don't have it!",UE
Beautiful and smooth photo streaming from device to device,UE

Cooooool App??????,UE

When my Weight Watchers membership expires, I'll continue to monitor my food intake with Lose It! In the meantime, I'm monitoring my progress with both apps so the transition is smooth. So far, I've found that Lose It! is much faster and easier to use.",UE

"Great app!! This made life easy, capturing family moments and saving for years to come I rated pretty few and Evernote are at the top of the list",UE
"This app is really useful for accessing documents while I'm out and about The only big thing I think it lacks is a way to share folders while you're using the app I'd love to be able to share a folder through the app, and I had to do this before while I was out and about, but unfortunately this app as of 3113 doesn't have this feature It would be really useful to have it!",UE
It's great how you can review an area and save the things you want to do in that area for your next visit.,UE

Finally. A safe place for my private photos. No more worrying about things being seen accidentally. Buy this.,UE

Excellent!!!! Love love love love!!!! I have so many new recipes and design ideas It is so much fun to see what friends like and pin also,UE
"Now that I have this app, I can't imagine how I got on without it. In my experience, it's about 98% accurate and the spoken directions are a necessity if you're traveling alone. An improvement would be to have the spoken directions a little earlier, especially on a busy highway. I would recommend this app to anyone looking for a reliable, accurate directions.",UE
The best thing I've ever tried??? It??? s been up for a long time.???,UE

My favorite app. It really works! You have to try it.,UE

It is a pure pleasure to have a photo when your friends call and sometimes contact information from your FB friends that you did not take the time to acquire. Fabulous!,UE
The new PDF-Reader is GREAT!!,UE
"I use it every time I'm out of time for restaurants and have never done anything wrong. I've tried other food apps that aren't nearly as accurate. A plus is that they don't mess with the ratings of fast food restaurants. Who needs a star rating for McDonalds, Burger King, etc.? Also very good to find a good hotel.",UE
This app works like a charm. You don't have to spend the extra time finding an available partner.,UE
"This has become my most important note-taking program. I wish I could write handwriting on it. Love, how can I store Outlook emails in it?",UE
"Very helpful to have it, but why some reviews aren't published here, I wrote negatively about the Best West Myrtle Beach hotel they don't want to publish. I hope this isn't like a BBB agency paying money to get good reviews.",UE
"I already gave a review when I first downloaded that this app is the best. Well, yesterday it proved to be the best. I have a health condition and yesterday I had to go to the hospital. I just emailed my list, printed it out and could give it to the doctor. Even the nurses and doctors were impressed. However, there is one thing I think would make this app even better. Add a COMMENTS section so you can write comments about yourself or the medication or whatever.",UE
It's a great app for taking notes for lessons on my tablet and still being able to access it over the internet.,UE
Really like this app. It's a very simple way to diary,UE
I find this app very useful. It has mechanisms and class information that most other free programs lack. It can't be done much better (especially for free)!,UE
"Green UI doesn't look good or feel good It's also no useful place to maximize space should be the goal, but it doesn't feel like it The app still works It's clunky and too much advertising Probably it's not even a problem that they've rolled out the ads at the wrong time",UE
I like this app and how I can place articles that I want to review at a later time. I use it to store recipes or interesting articles that I can read at a later time.,UE
"If the stars could be higher, I would rate them as that. I want to become an orthopedic surgeon and this is the best app I've ever come across to learn the skeletal system!!! I would recommend it to anyone, from a surgical intern to an A & P student in high school! Best thing, I can't say it enough!",UE
"I use it to track recipes, take notes on hobbies, keep up with maintenance.",UE

Exactly the biggest thing I love is that I can spend hours and hours on it! There's nothing I don't like!,UE

"PC, laptops, droids, tablets, two iPhones and a number of reference documents on all for me and the woman What the hell have I done by sending copies and updates in msgs and handwritten notes, I am so embarrassed that I did not find that 3 years ago?",UE
"As a writing daydreamer, I'm constantly thinking about new ideas, and having a tool to access my material wherever I go is fantastic. Instead of just writing down a note (which I can't always do) and pointing it out later when I get home, logging on to the computer and opening a Word document, it's so much easier and more convenient to do it with this app that I've even used Evernote for school work, essays most of the time, so there's no need to send me documents by email. There are just a few mistakes that I noticed, but nothing that makes me stop using this app, I love it too much!!",UE
"It is as accurate as any weather forecaster paid to get it 100% wrong. So far, this app has been close enough to allow me to dress appropriately, so too much scientific input is important to me. I just don't want to carry an umbrella when the sun is shining.",UE
"I love this app, super simple interface and I use it all the time.",UE
"Very useful, but sometimes it's difficult to type an essay without cross-sectional mode. It's ridiculous how a word-processing app can't type landscape.",UE
Only the required link Perfect solution for my Android / Linux environment. Works well with Tasker.,UE
"Very useful app, have fun looking and seeing what is available.",UE
I used this app recently during Hurricane Isaac. This app was updated faster and was much more reliable than the other two with the big websites. Get it. You may need it when it matters.,UE
Beautiful user interface Keep up the good work!,UE
"great item. Quick, easy ordering. Love fab.",UE
"I have now traveled through the US and several European countries and do not know how I have traveled without it. It has lost sight of the risk of invisible hotels and restaurants and led to many memorable stories. Yes, reviews are not always punctual, but 90% is a huge improvement.",UE
"I've always found Dropbox to be a bit faulty, but it's gotten worse since I upgraded to iOS 7. When I download zip files or web pages and open the files, the screen is blank, blackened, or a blurry enlarged image of the icon (from Facebook, Google, or other icons related to the page that the zip file or web page came from when I was a teacher), I rely on online & amp offline access to do research for my work as a teacher, and I need to write notes & amp as zip files to save space.",UE
"The only reason I switched to iOS7 was to get the latest version of Evernote. I have no idea what everyone is complaining about. Super easy to add notes still No sync issues Mobile phone announcements from Evernote The map indicator is still there, you just have to look (gasping) for a second.",UE
"Honestly, it took me a while to get used to the app - web clipping, photo notes, sharing, etc., but now I find that this app is the ""deal killer"" - the one thing that MUST be on any device - The note scanner is so powerful that it can read my scribbles (take notes in a meeting, take photos in evernote, throw them out!)",UE
"I never book a room without first checking the reviews on this page! I love how I can read reviews from ""real"" people and not what someone in marketing came up with to entice me to stay! I highly recommend it to everyone!",UE

The best information about hotels!,UE

"I loved Evernotesthat is Until I download iOS7 With their new and improved look they also eliminated everything you had ever saved.

"After downloading this, it just sat on my desktop for a million years. Then I came up with the brilliant idea of taking a screenshot of an Expedia itinerary Wow! Suddenly I'm running off, saving and retrieving information on everything from learning disabilities to salad dressings.

"Mint is a great way to get control of your finances, it really helps you with your spending and makes you aware of what you are spending your money on.",UE
"I use it when we travel, I'd rather find places and read reviews that others have published that I visit, and then post my thoughts. So far, those who use and rate places are very fair and honest.",UE
The other reason I got the app is that it can be exported to QuickBooks even though I haven't used it yet. The reports are great. I'd love to have main categories and sub-categories. I think that's the only thing missing to make this app a really robust standalone financial management app. Keep it up!,UE
Extremely helpful in France We were only in restaurants rated by TA,UE

During operation, changing functions such as iris control, white balance, etc. would no longer react unreproducibly.

"Thank you, Evernote, for a great app! I use it DAILY to keep my (gluten-free, dairy-free) recipes organized! One tip Please allow me to browse ALL of my notebooks - helpful to find an ingredient - rather than searching each notebook individually. I would also like to pay a flat fee to access my notes offline. Thank you",FR
"Nexus 4The game has no sound, please fix it!!!",FR
Unfortunately not a bad app. It started loading pictures and then brought me back to the homescreen without video or upload.,FR
OkLove the game but after updating its at 0mb / 0mb and not load im ysing the Samsung galaxy s4 active,FR
"When it works well! Keeps freezing and not completing so really annoying after you've spent so long doing it, lets app down because it's great when it works",FR
Gd appI think it's a great app uses it all the time to shut down other running apps.. altho i need to delete it bcuz i have no place on my phone but tilt! It won't uninstall at all says it needs to be b disabled which i still haven't uninstalled at all! NEED HELP!,FR
"Now that I have this app, I can't imagine how I got on without it. In my experience, it's about 98% accurate and the spoken directions are a necessity if you're traveling alone. An improvement would be to have the spoken directions a little earlier, especially on a busy highway. I would recommend this app to anyone looking for a reliable, accurate directions.",FR
"Native crash when selecting the new ship update: they fixed the 0 of 0 problem, but app has native crash when selecting the new ship... Professionals: nice graphics, nice ocean simulation. Cons: no immersive mode for 4.4 devices, the game is a bit short and game mode / event is too easy, the fight gets a bit boring after a few hours.",FR
"UpdateThe app refused to update, but others would. Had to uninstall.",FR
"Problem in activating Iv for a long time with viber nd it never disappointed me, but I have only deactivated my account for one day nd I am trying to activate... I do not get my code by txt nd I also do not get a call... I try again n please fix the problem",FR
"If we could create documentaries within the app, that would be great.",FR
"I love it until... The last update left me far from happy. Double-posting pictures that confuse the way cover photos look is no better, in fact it's worse. I give it 4 stars, now it barely gets 2. Please correct before I lose more fans.",FR
"Battery-hungry, if I had the application open, a full charge can be gone in 4 to 5 hours, whereas it normally lasts 16 hours... just needs to keep it open when needed.",FR
"New Update Is RubbishIt now really sloppy and slow when you go into the filters, for manual focus, for turning the flash on and off, I preferred the old interface - samsung galaxy s3 mini",FR
I sat down and calculated the IQ for each category based on the given data and the Average Professional College IQ used for this program 119.985 ~ 120.It would be really nice to have an integrated IQ Equiv function that shows us this information like the Excel calculator I created for myself. Keep it up!,FR
"I love the Brave version better than the original. The graphics are much better and I love the phrases it says. The goal of reaching 100 is stupid if I don't know how I did it, if I have improved or not, if there is no status for hit targets.",FR
I can't share folders! That was the only reason I made a Dropbox in the first place Ugh,FR
"The ability to use a scroll bar on iPad and iPhone instead of wiping, wiping, wiping and more to get to the bottom of a note. The ability to search for keywords AND THAT to go the keyword as you can on the laptop version is of no use to me if I can't search within the note to find out that WordCan you do these two things please for iOS?",FR
"It's a great app that I use every day... However, it crashes, and violence closes a hell of a lot on my Note 3. Fix this and it's 5 stars, as I much prefer the app to browsing the website on my phone.",FR
Pretty wired Sometimes it flashes green on the 1st opening and I have to close it and open it again. 5 stars if Yuo fixes this.,FR

Buggy app by updateAnother paid app fail. Edit: back to 1 star again! Crashes now every time a battle is won.,FR
"GoodEver since I downloaded this, I have had huge storage problems on my phone.",FR
"Good, but sad game overall, but could not reinstall an open game so and lost the progress. Also, I bought coins and also lost this. Otherwise, a great game.",FR
"I'm on an original iPad mini and that may be part of his deal, but it seems like there are still little thinner ones that require some work. For example, spell checking doesn't work properly and the search is sometimes slow. None of these or anyone else will stop you from giving this app a great rating. I also think there are improvements here that I hope to see in the future.",FR
"Finally the notifications are here. Now please give us a login with multiple accounts, Google.",FR
"It is impossible to refine a hotel search by criteria beyond location, price and quality. These are well done, and quality reviews and coverage are the reasons we use TA. Especially in high season, many of us travel with pets. We find it hard to find clean, reliable hotels. Most pet travel websites are woefully inadequate. How difficult would it be to include this as an additional search filter? This would provide helpful reviews that would not only improve the on-site experience, but also improve the field.",FR
"When I put things in my Dropbox folder on my desktop, I can find files by date, name, etc. The app has an incomprehensible and non-editable sorting function. It's almost impossible to find files within the app, once you've found them on your phone, I think you can ""prefer"" them, but the challenge is finding them.",FR
Still no way to change filenames - a very basic feature Hard to believe after this time error messages while simply trying to move files No answer from Dropbox,FR
"I tried to uninstall and reinstall, and it's the same. Before the last update it was fine.",FR
"LG Spiritmany bugs sometimes it wont shoot a picture and i have to reopen app, orientation when i turn the phone works about 20% of the time, touch focus is terrible, focus in general is terrible no matter what setting and other things as well. HD CAMERA PRO takes MUCH better pictures and its free. Stop adding so many features... who cares what frame i put on a blurry picture?",FR
"Hello Dropbox team! Please add the ability to rename files, as well as the ability to play GIFs, I know you can!!",FR
It would be nice to have a grid view of photos that is not only the automatic upload of the camera roll. It would also be nice to rename filesMy last review is not fixed yet This app does not support Mobi file uploads. It would be nice to save my Mobi files.,FR
"Needs ART support game has just been updated today and still does not support ART runtime. Opens on the main screen, then closes the force. Works well on dalvik, but it is the only app I have that does not work on ART. Once this problem has been solved, rating and rating will be updated.",FR
I wish it was able to determine which hole you are on.,FR
"Can not read text boxes well, but does not seem to read documents with text boxes and images very well...",FR
"If you are running Android 4.4.2 Kit on a Nexus 7 2013, I assume that it will necessarily close when I use ART runtime. Please update to work with ART!: -)",FR

Galax s4Can't search for friends online,FR
"First of all, both Dragon Dictation and Dragon Search are amazing and I use the slow 3G. They are more than amazing on my wife's iPhone 4! As a heavy user of Dragon Dictation, it would be very useful to unlock the screen and start a new one, perhaps by shaking the iPhone. Sometimes it is easier to start over than to edit a word.",FR
HhfgToo slow to download,FR
"Broken Multiplayer Multiplayer doesn't work at all, I just can't connect every time. Would give 5 stars if online is ever repaired.",FR
"Fine when it works, but annoying when it plays up Getting fed up with having to uninstall because it doesn't allow you to work on a new image....",FR
No ignore list on Nexus 7 with Android 4.3Fix it please.,FR
"The game continues to creep up on me, please fix it.",FR
It seems like it would be a great addition to have the hold mail function from your website here as well. Please include this in the next version!,FR
"Seems funnyThis seems to be a fun game, but crashes again and again when it comes to a new screen.",FR
No Sound.Google Nexus 7 2013 This is otherwise a 5 star game. Fix the sound so I can change my rating.,FR
I love the app because it allows me to keep my notes organized and in sync across different devices. I also love the feature of sharing things with friends The only thing I crave is working on notes.,FR
"The new update loads more slowly, locks me out when I press BACK to view photos, this update has glitches that I don't like and I wish you would make it easier to find RESORTS hotels that resemble the ones you saw a few months ago when I saw a 5 star resort with a lazy river, it shows me similar resorts, I would like to stay somewhere else (state, country)",FR
"Thanks for app, but can I add offline mod? For example, I want to save a video to my iPhone and then play it with VLC",FR
"Great game, but..... I like this game, but it does not display properly on my Samsung Galaxy Ace. I get a white background. Please fix it or I want my money back.",FR
Great applicationOne of the great application for chat Please just increase the upload limit This will be very useful,FR
"It would be good if... It would be good if the focus wasn't screwed. Works well with all other camera apps except this one. Focus as a macro behaves like setting to Auto, Setting as a car behaves like Macro. And forget about it if it's a night shot.",FR
Wont loadI got to play in this for a few weeks now suddenly it will not load,FR
"The fact that you can search within folders is extremely useful and makes accessing files on the go much more convenient. I also think that the latest style update is a big plus in the right direction. I use Dropbox on all my devices, which I would like to see improved within the app (e.g. by date), but otherwise it's good.",FR
"Overall, it's a great app. I use it every day. It would be helpful if it included entrance and communion antiphons. I don't appreciate the new app purchase feature. The saint of the day should either be included in the program or have a way to remove the purchase button for those who don't want to buy it.",FR
PerfectVry gud app for editingplz adds a few more interesting frames),FR
"I tend to post reviews spontaneously and my only wish is that I can edit them via the app. I also wish there was a way to respond to replies. A hotel has described itself accurately on TripAdvisor but was misleading on its website, but I can't point that out.",FR
"This app and application has a poor user interface, allowing all kinds of strangers to harass you is not intuitive. The message only works sometimes, no notice has been read or not. It's a bandwidth hog. Companies hate it on their networks. Oh, and I haven't installed it yet. Part of the herd....: (",FR
"How disappointing!! I love the ease of uploading images and music.. however. EVERY SINGLE TIME I GO TO POSIT MY VIDEO, IT CAN NOT PLAY VIDEO.. ON.TOP OF THAT I HAVE paid 1.99 for my own watermark and CAN NOT SEE MY VIDEO!!!",FR
"Not bad on android, but.. for some reason I can't watch the album of my pages in full screen mode (instead I got a small preview in the middle with left / right button on both sides... But on the iOS version the photos are full screen, please fix this!!! Thanks!",FR
Sony xperia spSony xperia sp native resolution not supported,FR

Was good until the cent updates Now my notes disappear randomly and I keep getting a synchronization error This app also needs additional features,FR
"SO DUMB.I paid for this game. Tried to download it, and it will not let me... I also can not get a refund! IT CONSTRUCTS!!",FR
"The only good thing about the last update is the ability to create folders, but you can't create folders within folders. I wish you could. The bad thing about the last update? Now typing has a delay that's very annoying. I don't understand how that happened because there's no crazy graphical user interface or anything animated. The most important thing that's pretty good for most people is removing the TAB key. I always hated that the TAB key was at the top of the ruler. I'd prefer to have just a shift key and place the TAB on the keyboard, but now I wish it was at the top. Now you have to go through a complicated process and menu to use it. I've stopped using Pages now because it's so painful to press it when you're not using Bluetooth keyboard.",FR
"I'd give him a 5, of course, if I could pin it on Pinterest.",FR
Excellent Would be nice if the functions of the PC app were available in the iOS app,FR
This update would be a step up if you could actually see the PDFs with it.,FR
"You should add the photo editing option, then this app would be perfect.",FR
"Mixed Review This game works great on my HTC Desire X, but not on my samsung galaxy tab3 (stick jellybean) (weapons and everything else goes invisible and is almost impossible to play) Please fix this as it is a great game.",FR
BuggedThe last update caused the game to stop working. It does not even start now. Please fix. New update still does not fix anything.: /,FR
? Why can't I log into separate drop box accounts?,FR
"Nice app, but needs the ability to share folders For people who are on the go, we need to be able to send links by email to people, sending tons of individual links to people is not feasible",FR
Please complete the landscape care for your obese users!,FR
Bad controlIt's really hard to play. Controls are a real challenge. And it kills all the fun.,FR
"One feature you should add is the ability to import multiple photos to the camera roll, then it is better",FR
"UselessUnusable. If you try to find the right forum, you have to scroll down forever!",FR
Hope it had whatsapp to sms though!,FR
Developer nd attention here.Aftr processing the quality of the image gts dampened or gets bad... need ths all repair,FR
"Can we get push notifications for other things that are shared, except folders My friend is a photographer, he often sticks photos in our shared folder - wants a notification when things arrive (I turned them on but never get it)",FR
"Useful, improvedSatisfied with the progress of this app, but there are many updates that don't seem to make any changes Can't see the names of many boards - there needs to be a text function on the board name for long board names to be visible Indexing is also very slow, many of my pins take weeks to find",FR
>: (The app closes when I take a photo >: (,FR
I just wish it would notify me if I fall short of a certain dollar amount,FR
Still no gallery in Camera Upload mode!,FR
"Video Playback sucksThis is a wonderful app minus the videos To play one it takes you to an internet browser, then to youtube Please allow for in-app playback to bypass all the nonsense",FR
"This really is a great app a tool to manage multiple projects and scattered notes I just wish there was a calendar integration and subfolders within stacks Also in Evernote hello there is no categorization But make no mistake, I swear on this program",FR
Great app!! Useful and easy to use!,FR
"Bummer: / Seen a friend post a video on Facebook, then I downloaded the app.. all I can do is select photos and it won't let me go on after I choose which one I want to use..: (she keeps telling me there is an error",FR
bugs bugs bugsslots bug I can't login anymore... my device is delayed when trying to open the app... fix it sucks!!!,FR
"Will not install.If you have a Nexus 4 with a lot of free space, but the installer says it has 0 MB available.",FR
"Can I go back to an older version? Loved the app, was fast and always connected until the last update. I tried every suggestion. When I first open it, nothing happens, it just sits on a blank screen. Need to close and reopen several times and it's so slow to connect now. Hope it improves. To be fair, I did the same with the latest Tappatalk upgrade. Galaxy Note",FR
"I love this game, but since the update it crashes every time I sink my first fight since the update. I am on Galaxy Note 2. Please fix it and I will return to 5 stars.",FR
You should add the feature to purchase Starbucks gift cards through the iTunes store. I wonder if they will add that when iOS6 comes with passbook?,FR
The other reason I got the app is that it can be exported to QuickBooks even though I haven't used it yet. The reports are great. I'd love to have main categories and sub-categories. I think that's the only thing missing to make this app a really robust standalone financial management app. Keep it up!,FR
Slowly loading the first buggy update,FR
Please insert the option to enlarge the thumbnail during viewing in the photo folder.,FR
"Multiplayer cant joinCant join games, just keeps search. I tried to join custom and says error can not join",FR
"Every time I get ready to use the photo frame and select a photo when I return to the photo frame, it just shows the texture. I have to go through the same problem every time I use it. The only way to get it right until I want to use it again is to restart my phone. Please fix it!! ASAP",FR
"A good app, but to make it a great app, video would be a great feature. A must is to make the timer continuous. After the 5-second countdown, it would be great if it would automatically restart for continuous self-recording. Please add that.",FR
"FreezesIt is a good game, but sometimes it crashes and has to be forcibly stopped and restarted",FR
"I love this app. It's so easy to learn how to use it and it's very easy to understand. The only thing I don't like is that when you choose the option to show how the temperature feels, you can't see what the temperature actually is. I'd love to be able to see both at the same time.",FR
"Camera DOOM FXPictures does not store on an external SD card. In fact, they store in a temporary folder and do not even show up in the gallery. Email Dev replied that he is dealing with it, but has not heard anything since.",FR
"Great information is available on wish maps (the locations of newer hotels have been updated) Also, it would be great to have an individual resort map of all available resorts. It would be great if age and renovation dates were also included for hotels.",FR
BaddThe New Update One sucks. It can even save the painter.,FR
Its amazing The only thing it can do better is to have the ability or export videos to your Camara reel,FR
"I have been using Dropbox for quite some time, have earned a lot of space and love being able to retrieve all of my files from my iPhone, iPad, MacBook and the Internet through someone else's computer, but these last two updates have disabled the camera save feature, which I use all the time and have found several times since the new update. Please add this feature back! I know I can only take one screenshot, but I prefer the clean copy you get without anyone being afraid to save images on the camera roll!",FR
"Not happy I downloaded this app because I got the first one and I liked it, but this one is not even loaded to my phone, all I get is a black screen and music plz fix",FR
Wonderful Butt Could be better if all the tools were built in and not dependent on the network connection,FR
Please fix this I still can not download it..,FR
"You should select the folder first and then the files! I would put a folder as a favorite, so all the files within this as a favorite",FR
"Holds auto-delete every 3 daysThis app is pretty nice, but since the last update it deletes automatically. I've reinstalled it three times, including today. That's just wrong!",FR
"It just needs to play the next song after one ends, and it will definitely get the 5 stars",FR
Does almost anything except allow me to make a quick chart by hand But it allows me to take a photo and record the voice so that helps,FR
"It is very convenient to use, but not being able to switch between accounts without unplugging the phone would be great. Also, improving the media player would help.",FR
"I was hoping that the update would bring back the ""Open in"" option, but it did not mean that importing files to other apps is now a big pain Why was this option removed? Please bring it back",FR
It needs to be improved,FR
"In fact, I think this app is absolutely brilliant when it comes to helping me prepare for my boards. However, just as the muscle name is indicated in the audio, I wish there was an option to hear all the information about the muscles in the audio.",FR
"Great! Only the complaint will be able to change the image that represents your boards, and only a more user-friendly way to change settings and add images to your boards.",FR
"Problems I logged in and tried to log back in later, and it says that I have no pages to manage.",FR
"Is Dropbox design for iOS 7, but is still the same more or less Air Drop is the only new in this update (for iPhone) I think 4 out of 5 because still can't rename files",FR
"Like a lotBut if you change the flash setting, it still activates in the OFF position. Freeze. Sometimes not focus and I have to reinstall or delete data to get it working again.",FR
"It should be as simple and simple as that. I give it 5 stars despite some shortcomings: 1. It would be nice to sync with the desktop (iCal?) and between devices; 2. It needs reminders and warnings (and due dates, etc.) 3. Any support for longer notes. At the moment, you can edit the item with just a tap on it. Maybe you should double-tap to open the ""details page"" of an item where you can enter the due date, add an alarm or type a longer note. 4. Also sharing a list? It would be great if my wife and I could add shopping lists to each other or just see each other.",FR
"Nice update, but still prone to crashingNew updates now great... but still crashing at some point while playing in Chapter 5 while fighting stormy weather... press force on the start screen ~ hope for corrections",FR

"Hanging up the phone is hanging up the phone, so I have to do 2 reboots >",FR
Great app - nice layout But I wish saved articles could be viewed offline!,FR
"This is a very useful and helpful app. In my opinion, the only thing missing is the handling of videos. You can add pictures and audio to your notes, and I think you should also be able to add videos.",FR
"After the update, this game crashes after every battle. Please fix the problem!",FR
"I love to insert notes to remember that I am pasting my passwords. I insert copies of receipts and everything I need to find later, and I can easily find it in one place. Also, the search option is very handy.",FR
"Some help here? My messages are not sent, and they keep saying. Help would be nice.",FR
"Wont create teamThe game is good, but when I try to create the team, I only get a go-back button.",FR
Could be better app freezes time to time and delays.,FR

"This could easily be a 5-star app Best idea ever, but it loses 2 stars just because I have to download one photo at a time This is a huge inconvenience",FR
Please also support animated GIFs!,FR
Black ScreenI get black screen after using flash. It seems to be random.,FR
Some places that had menus in the old version are missing in the new version. Apart from the fact that the app is extremely helpful and easy to use.,FR
"Not very impressive I am a PhD student and use my tablet a lot to take notes during the presentation and read essays. I am disappointed as I cannot use the software to present ppt. Also, the draw option is not very user friendly as it does not allow to draw or delete in different colors.",FR
"Bad!!! When I want to take a photo, the picture from my camera phone is not shown, just bare.. plis fix it. My phone is samsung galaxy young s5360",FR
Love itGreat app which gave there a way to edit multiple checkpins (delete or move to another board) rather than do it individually,FR
"Functionality is as advertised, but still buggyI use DSLR controllers via Wifi on a 6D. During operation, changing functions such as iris control, white balance, etc. would no longer react unreproducibly. Timed exposure (the only advantage over Canon's own app and the reason I bought the app) causes an app and camera crash (!). Disappointing and expensive. I continue to hope for more reliable updates.",FR
"I just wish you could edit your Word documents, except that it's great!",FR
zzzzzzkeeps closing / crashing losing all my work zzzz FIX IT!,FR
"The game itself is not bad. If anything, it's a bit monotonous. However, the manual is less than desirable, especially when it comes to how to feed cows. I made up meadows myself, but can't make bales of straw for my life. Apparently, this is HKW to produce fertilizer for manure and farmland. I sent an email to the developers, but got no response. VERY FRUSTRATING! You spend money in the game on equipment you can't use.",FR
Slow.BuggyIt takes more than a minute to open a file that will be opened in 10 seconds in Polaris Office Tab 2-3100. Needs a speed improvement. Edit: It only shows a blank white screen when we try to open some.doc files!! OMG developers! I hope you have tested the file I sent you.,FR

"This app has been very helpful in my honeymoon search. It would be nice to be able to enlarge the photos, but otherwise it is perfect.",FR
"ShockingPlayed this on an iPad and it was quality. Download it on my Xperia z tablet and the game is upside down. It is impossible to play and survive the refund period, in my opinion it is not worth the risk of losing 2.99.",FR
"Annoyed, I'd like to log in and it stays logged in. My camera wouldn't work here either, but it works well with my other apps.... needs to be repaired as quickly as possible.",FR
"No grocery stores, cafes or anything that isn't fast food or big chains. No coffee shops except Starbucks and no foreign food and definitely nothing remotely healthy.

"The only good thing about the last update is the ability to create folders, but you can't create folders within folders. I wish you could. The bad thing about the last update? Now typing has a delay that's very annoying. I don't understand how that happened because there's no crazy graphical user interface or anything animated. The most important thing that's pretty good for most people is removing the TAB key. I always hated that the TAB key was at the top of the ruler. I'd prefer to have just a shift key and place the TAB on the keyboard, but now I wish it was at the top. Now you have to go through a complicated process and menu to use it.

You should add the feature to purchase Starbucks gift cards through the iTunes store. I wonder if they will add that when iOS6 comes with passbook?,FR
The other reason I got the app is that it can be exported to QuickBooks even though I haven't used it yet. The reports are great. I'd love to have main categories and sub-categories.

"It should be as simple and simple as that. I give it 5 stars despite some shortcomings: 1. It would be nice to sync with the desktop (iCal?) and between devices; 2. It needs reminders and warnings (and due dates, etc.) 3. Any support for longer notes. At the moment, you can edit the item with just a tap on it. Maybe you should double-tap to open the ""details page"" of an item where you can enter the due date, add an alarm or type a longer note. 4. Also sharing a list?

"The only good thing about the last update is the ability to create folders, but you can't create folders within folders. I wish you could. The bad thing about the last update? Now typing has a delay that's very annoying. I don't understand how that happened because there's no crazy graphical user interface or anything animated. The most important thing that's pretty good for most people is removing the TAB key. I always hated that the TAB key was at the top of the ruler. I'd prefer to have just a shift key and place the TAB on the keyboard, but now I wish it was at the top. Now you have to go through a complicated process and menu to use it. I've stopped using Pages now because it's so painful to press it when you're not using Bluetooth keyboard.",FR

To be fair, I did the same with the latest Tappatalk upgrade. Galaxy Note",FR
"I love this game, but since the update it crashes every time I sink my first fight since the update. I am on Galaxy Note 2. Please fix it and I will return to 5 stars.",FR
You should add the feature to purchase Starbucks gift cards through the iTunes store. I wonder if they will add that when iOS6 comes with passbook?,FR
The other reason I got the app is that it can be exported to QuickBooks even though I haven't used it yet. The reports are great. I'd love to have main categories and sub-categories.

"FreezesIt is a good game, but sometimes it crashes and has to be forcibly stopped and restarted",FR
"I love this app. It's so easy to learn how to use it and it's very easy to understand. The only thing I don't like is that when you choose the option to show how the temperature feels, you can't see what the temperature actually is. I'd love to be able to see both at the same time.",FR

"It should be as simple and simple as that. I give it 5 stars despite some shortcomings: 1. It would be nice to sync with the desktop (iCal?) and between devices; 2. It needs reminders and warnings (and due dates, etc.) 3. Any support for longer notes. At the moment, you can edit the item with just a tap on it. Maybe you should double-tap to open the ""details page"" of an item where you can enter the due date, add an alarm or type a longer note. 4. Also sharing a list?

During operation, changing functions such as iris control, white balance, etc. would no longer react unreproducibly.

"The fact that you can search within folders is extremely useful and makes accessing files on the go much more convenient.

I use Dropbox on all my devices, which I would like to see improved within the app (e.g. by date), but otherwise it's good.",FR
"Overall, it's a great app. I use it every day. It would be helpful if it included entrance and communion antiphons. I don't appreciate the new app purchase feature.

"The only good thing about the last update is the ability to create folders, but you can't create folders within folders. I wish you could. The bad thing about the last update? Now typing has a delay that's very annoying. I don't understand how that happened because there's no crazy graphical user interface or anything animated. The most important thing that's pretty good for most people is removing the TAB key. I always hated that the TAB key was at the top of the ruler. I'd prefer to have just a shift key and place the TAB on the keyboard, but now I wish it was at the top. Now you have to go through a complicated process and menu to use it. I've stopped using Pages now because it's so painful to press it when you're not using Bluetooth keyboard.",FR

To be fair, I did the same with the latest Tappatalk upgrade. Galaxy Note",FR
"I love this game, but since the update it crashes every time I sink my first fight since the update. I am on Galaxy Note 2. Please fix it and I will return to 5 stars.",FR
You should add the feature to purchase Starbucks gift cards through the iTunes store. I wonder if they will add that when iOS6 comes with passbook?,FR
The other reason I got the app is that it can be exported to QuickBooks even though I haven't used it yet. The reports are great. I'd love to have main categories and sub-categories.

"A good app, but to make it a great app, video would be a great feature. A must is to make the timer continuous. After the 5-second countdown, it would be great if it would automatically restart for continuous self-recording. Please add that.",FR
"FreezesIt is a good game, but sometimes it crashes and has to be forcibly stopped and restarted",FR
"I love this app. It's so easy to learn how to use it and it's very easy to understand. The only thing I don't like is that when you choose the option to show how the temperature feels, you can't see what the temperature actually is. I'd love to be able to see both at the same time.",FR

"It should be as simple and simple as that. I give it 5 stars despite some shortcomings: 1. It would be nice to sync with the desktop (iCal?) and between devices; 2. It needs reminders and warnings (and due dates, etc.) 3. Any support for longer notes. At the moment, you can edit the item with just a tap on it. Maybe you should double-tap to open the ""details page"" of an item where you can enter the due date, add an alarm or type a longer note. 4. Also sharing a list? It would be great if my wife and I could add shopping lists to each other or just see each other.",FR

"Functionality is as advertised, but still buggyI use DSLR controllers via Wifi on a 6D. During operation, changing functions such as iris control, white balance, etc. would no longer react unreproducibly.

"The game itself is not bad. If anything, it's a bit monotonous. However, the manual is less than desirable, especially when it comes to how to feed cows. I made up meadows myself, but can't make bales of straw for my life. Apparently, this is HKW to produce fertilizer for manure and farmland. I sent an email to the developers, but got no response.

"The only good thing about the last update is the ability to create folders, but you can't create folders within folders. I wish you could. The bad thing about the last update? Now typing has a delay that's very annoying. I don't understand how that happened because there's no crazy graphical user interface or anything animated. The most important thing that's pretty good for most people is removing the TAB key. I always hated that the TAB key was at the top of the ruler. I'd prefer to have just a shift key and place the TAB on the keyboard, but now I wish it was at the top. Now you have to go through a complicated process and menu to use it. I've stopped using Pages now because it's so painful to press it when you're not using Bluetooth keyboard.",FR

You should add the feature to purchase Starbucks gift cards through the iTunes store. I wonder if they will add that when iOS6 comes with passbook?,FR
The other reason I got the app is that it can be exported to QuickBooks even though I haven't used it yet. The reports are great. I'd love to have main categories and sub-categories.

"It should be as simple and simple as that. I give it 5 stars despite some shortcomings: 1. It would be nice to sync with the desktop (iCal?) and between devices; 2. It needs reminders and warnings (and due dates, etc.) 3. Any support for longer notes. At the moment, you can edit the item with just a tap on it. Maybe you should double-tap to open the ""details page"" of an item where you can enter the due date, add an alarm or type a longer note. 4. Also sharing a list?

The most important thing that's pretty good for most people is removing the TAB key. I always hated that the TAB key was at the top of the ruler. I'd prefer to have just a shift key and place the TAB on the keyboard, but now I wish it was at the top. Now you have to go through a complicated process and menu to use it.

When I first open it, nothing happens, it just sits on a blank screen. Need to close and reopen several times and it's so slow to connect now. Hope it improves. To be fair, I did the same with the latest Tappatalk upgrade. Galaxy Note",FR
"I love this game, but since the update it crashes every time I sink my first fight since the update. I am on Galaxy Note 2. Please fix it and I will return to 5 stars.",FR
You should add the feature to purchase Starbucks gift cards through the iTunes store. I wonder if they will add that when iOS6 comes with passbook?,FR
The other reason I got the app is that it can be exported to QuickBooks even though I haven't used it yet. The reports are great. I'd love to have main categories and sub-categories. I think that's the only thing missing to make this app a really robust standalone financial management app. Keep it up!,FR

"A good app, but to make it a great app, video would be a great feature. A must is to make the timer continuous. After the 5-second countdown, it would be great if it would automatically restart for continuous self-recording. Please add that.",FR
"FreezesIt is a good game, but sometimes it crashes and has to be forcibly stopped and restarted",FR
"I love this app. It's so easy to learn how to use it and it's very easy to understand. The only thing I don't like is that when you choose the option to show how the temperature feels, you can't see what the temperature actually is. I'd love to be able to see both at the same time.",FR

"It should be as simple and simple as that. I give it 5 stars despite some shortcomings: 1. It would be nice to sync with the desktop (iCal?) and between devices; 2. It needs reminders and warnings (and due dates, etc.) 3. Any support for longer notes. At the moment, you can edit the item with just a tap on it. Maybe you should double-tap to open the ""details page"" of an item where you can enter the due date, add an alarm or type a longer note. 4. Also sharing a list? It would be great if my wife and I could add shopping lists to each other or just see each other.",FR

"Functionality is as advertised, but still buggyI use DSLR controllers via Wifi on a 6D. During operation, changing functions such as iris control, white balance, etc. would no longer react unreproducibly.

"The game itself is not bad. If anything, it's a bit monotonous. However, the manual is less than desirable, especially when it comes to how to feed cows. I made up meadows myself, but can't make bales of straw for my life. Apparently, this is HKW to produce fertilizer for manure and farmland. I sent an email to the developers, but got no response.

"Now that I have this app, I can't imagine how I got on without it. In my experience, it's about 98% accurate and the spoken directions are a necessity if you're traveling alone.

"I'm on an original iPad mini and that may be part of his deal, but it seems like there are still little thinner ones that require some work. For example, spell checking doesn't work properly and the search is sometimes slow. None of these or anyone else will stop you from giving this app a great rating. I also think there are improvements here that I hope to see in the future.",FR

"It is impossible to refine a hotel search by criteria beyond location, price and quality. These are well done, and quality reviews and coverage are the reasons we use TA. Especially in high season, many of us travel with pets. We find it hard to find clean, reliable hotels. Most pet travel websites are woefully inadequate. How difficult would it be to include this as an additional search filter? This would provide helpful reviews that would not only improve the on-site experience, but also improve the field.",FR
"When I put things in my Dropbox folder on my desktop, I can find files by date, name, etc. The app has an incomprehensible and non-editable sorting function.

"The fact that you can search within folders is extremely useful and makes accessing files on the go much more convenient.

I use Dropbox on all my devices, which I would like to see improved within the app (e.g. by date), but otherwise it's good.",FR
"Overall, it's a great app. I use it every day. It would be helpful if it included entrance and communion antiphons. I don't appreciate the new app purchase feature.

"The only good thing about the last update is the ability to create folders, but you can't create folders within folders. I wish you could. The bad thing about the last update? Now typing has a delay that's very annoying. I don't understand how that happened because there's no crazy graphical user interface or anything animated. The most important thing that's pretty good for most people is removing the TAB key. I always hated that the TAB key was at the top of the ruler. I'd prefer to have just a shift key and place the TAB on the keyboard, but now I wish it was at the top. Now you have to go through a complicated process and menu to use it. I've stopped using Pages now because it's so painful to press it when you're not using Bluetooth keyboard.",FR

You should add the feature to purchase Starbucks gift cards through the iTunes store. I wonder if they will add that when iOS6 comes with passbook?,FR
The other reason I got the app is that it can be exported to QuickBooks even though I haven't used it yet. The reports are great. I'd love to have main categories and sub-categories.

Its amazing The only thing it can do better is to have the ability or export videos to your Camara reel,FR
"I have been using Dropbox for quite some time, have earned a lot of space and love being able to retrieve all of my files from my iPhone, iPad, MacBook and the Internet through someone else's computer, but these last two updates have disabled the camera save feature, which I use all the time and have found several times since the new update. Please add this feature back! I know I can only take one screenshot, but I prefer the clean copy you get without anyone being afraid to save images on the camera roll!",FR
"Not happy I downloaded this app because I got the first one and I liked it, but this one is not even loaded to my phone, all I get is a black screen and music plz fix",FR

Please fix this I still can not download it..,FR
"You should select the folder first and then the files! I would put a folder as a favorite, so all the files within this as a favorite",FR

"It just needs to play the next song after one ends, and it will definitely get the 5 stars",FR
Does almost anything except allow me to make a quick chart by hand But it allows me to take a photo and record the voice so that helps,FR
"It is very convenient to use, but not being able to switch between accounts without unplugging the phone would be great. Also, improving the media player would help.",FR

"Like a lotBut if you change the flash setting, it still activates in the OFF position. Freeze. Sometimes not focus and I have to reinstall or delete data to get it working again.",FR
"It should be as simple and simple as that. I give it 5 stars despite some shortcomings: 1. It would be nice to sync with the desktop (iCal?) and between devices; 2. It needs reminders and warnings (and due dates, etc.) 3. Any support for longer notes. At the moment, you can edit the item with just a tap on it. Maybe you should double-tap to open the ""details page"" of an item where you can enter the due date, add an alarm or type a longer note. 4. Also sharing a list? It would be great if my wife and I could add shopping lists to each other or just see each other.",FR

"After the update, this game crashes after every battle. Please fix the problem!",FR
"I love to insert notes to remember that I am pasting my passwords. I insert copies of receipts and everything I need to find later, and I can easily find it in one place. Also, the search option is very handy.",FR

"Functionality is as advertised, but still buggyI use DSLR controllers via Wifi on a 6D. During operation, changing functions such as iris control, white balance, etc. would no longer react unreproducibly. Timed exposure (the only advantage over Canon's own app and the reason I bought the app) causes an app and camera crash (!). Disappointing and expensive. I continue to hope for more reliable updates.",FR
"I just wish you could edit your Word documents, except that it's great!",FR
zzzzzzkeeps closing / crashing losing all my work zzzz FIX IT!,FR
"The game itself is not bad. If anything, it's a bit monotonous. However, the manual is less than desirable, especially when it comes to how to feed cows. I made up meadows myself, but can't make bales of straw for my life. Apparently, this is HKW to produce fertilizer for manure and farmland. I sent an email to the developers, but got no response. VERY FRUSTRATING! You spend money in the game on equipment you can't use.",FR
Slow.BuggyIt takes more than a minute to open a file that will be opened in 10 seconds in Polaris Office Tab 2-3100. Needs a speed improvement. Edit: It only shows a blank white screen when we try to open some.doc files!! OMG developers! I hope you have tested the file I sent you.,FR

"ShockingPlayed this on an iPad and it was quality. Download it on my Xperia z tablet and the game is upside down. It is impossible to play and survive the refund period, in my opinion it is not worth the risk of losing 2.99.",FR

"No grocery stores, cafes or anything that isn't fast food or big chains. No coffee shops except Starbucks and no foreign food and definitely nothing remotely healthy.

"Now that I have this app, I can't imagine how I got on without it. In my experience, it's about 98% accurate and the spoken directions are a necessity if you're traveling alone. An improvement would be to have the spoken directions a little earlier, especially on a busy highway. I would recommend this app to anyone looking for a reliable, accurate directions.",FR
"Native crash when selecting the new ship update: they fixed the 0 of 0 problem, but app has native crash when selecting the new ship... Professionals: nice graphics, nice ocean simulation.

Keep it up!,FR
"I love the Brave version better than the original. The graphics are much better and I love the phrases it says. The goal of reaching 100 is stupid if I don't know how I did it, if I have improved or not, if there is no status for hit targets.",FR

"The ability to use a scroll bar on iPad and iPhone instead of wiping, wiping, wiping and more to get to the bottom of a note.

"I'm on an original iPad mini and that may be part of his deal, but it seems like there are still little thinner ones that require some work. For example, spell checking doesn't work properly and the search is sometimes slow. None of these or anyone else will stop you from giving this app a great rating. I also think there are improvements here that I hope to see in the future.",FR
"Finally the notifications are here. Now please give us a login with multiple accounts, Google.",FR
"It is impossible to refine a hotel search by criteria beyond location, price and quality. These are well done, and quality reviews and coverage are the reasons we use TA. Especially in high season, many of us travel with pets. We find it hard to find clean, reliable hotels. Most pet travel websites are woefully inadequate. How difficult would it be to include this as an additional search filter? This would provide helpful reviews that would not only improve the on-site experience, but also improve the field.",FR
"When I put things in my Dropbox folder on my desktop, I can find files by date, name, etc. The app has an incomprehensible and non-editable sorting function. It's almost impossible to find files within the app, once you've found them on your phone, I think you can ""prefer"" them, but the challenge is finding them.",FR

"The new update loads more slowly, locks me out when I press BACK to view photos, this update has glitches that I don't like and I wish you would make it easier to find RESORTS hotels that resemble the ones you saw a few months ago when I saw a 5 star resort with a lazy river, it shows me similar resorts, I would like to stay somewhere else (state, country)",FR

Wont loadI got to play in this for a few weeks now suddenly it will not load,FR
"The fact that you can search within folders is extremely useful and makes accessing files on the go much more convenient. I also think that the latest style update is a big plus in the right direction. I use Dropbox on all my devices, which I would like to see improved within the app (e.g. by date), but otherwise it's good.",FR
"Overall, it's a great app. I use it every day. It would be helpful if it included entrance and communion antiphons. I don't appreciate the new app purchase feature.

"The only good thing about the last update is the ability to create folders, but you can't create folders within folders. I wish you could. The bad thing about the last update? Now typing has a delay that's very annoying. I don't understand how that happened because there's no crazy graphical user interface or anything animated. The most important thing that's pretty good for most people is removing the TAB key. I always hated that the TAB key was at the top of the ruler. I'd prefer to have just a shift key and place the TAB on the keyboard, but now I wish it was at the top. Now you have to go through a complicated process and menu to use it. I've stopped using Pages now because it's so painful to press it when you're not using Bluetooth keyboard.",FR

To be fair, I did the same with the latest Tappatalk upgrade. Galaxy Note",FR
"I love this game, but since the update it crashes every time I sink my first fight since the update. I am on Galaxy Note 2. Please fix it and I will return to 5 stars.",FR
You should add the feature to purchase Starbucks gift cards through the iTunes store. I wonder if they will add that when iOS6 comes with passbook?,FR
The other reason I got the app is that it can be exported to QuickBooks even though I haven't used it yet. The reports are great. I'd love to have main categories and sub-categories.

During operation, changing functions such as iris control, white balance, etc. would no longer react unreproducibly.

"The game itself is not bad. If anything, it's a bit monotonous. However, the manual is less than desirable, especially when it comes to how to feed cows. I made up meadows myself, but can't make bales of straw for my life. Apparently, this is HKW to produce fertilizer for manure and farmland. I sent an email to the developers, but got no response.

"I'm on an original iPad mini and that may be part of his deal, but it seems like there are still little thinner ones that require some work.

How difficult would it be to include this as an additional search filter? This would provide helpful reviews that would not only improve the on-site experience, but also improve the field.",FR
"When I put things in my Dropbox folder on my desktop, I can find files by date, name, etc. The app has an incomprehensible and non-editable sorting function.

"The fact that you can search within folders is extremely useful and makes accessing files on the go much more convenient. I also think that the latest style update is a big plus in the right direction. I use Dropbox on all my devices, which I would like to see improved within the app (e.g. by date), but otherwise it's good.",FR
"Overall, it's a great app. I use it every day. It would be helpful if it included entrance and communion antiphons. I don't appreciate the new app purchase feature.

"The only good thing about the last update is the ability to create folders, but you can't create folders within folders. I wish you could. The bad thing about the last update? Now typing has a delay that's very annoying. I don't understand how that happened because there's no crazy graphical user interface or anything animated. The most important thing that's pretty good for most people is removing the TAB key. I always hated that the TAB key was at the top of the ruler. I'd prefer to have just a shift key and place the TAB on the keyboard, but now I wish it was at the top. Now you have to go through a complicated process and menu to use it. I've stopped using Pages now because it's so painful to press it when you're not using Bluetooth keyboard.",FR

To be fair, I did the same with the latest Tappatalk upgrade. Galaxy Note",FR
"I love this game, but since the update it crashes every time I sink my first fight since the update. I am on Galaxy Note 2. Please fix it and I will return to 5 stars.",FR
You should add the feature to purchase Starbucks gift cards through the iTunes store. I wonder if they will add that when iOS6 comes with passbook?,FR
The other reason I got the app is that it can be exported to QuickBooks even though I haven't used it yet. The reports are great. I'd love to have main categories and sub-categories.

"FreezesIt is a good game, but sometimes it crashes and has to be forcibly stopped and restarted",FR
"I love this app. It's so easy to learn how to use it and it's very easy to understand. The only thing I don't like is that when you choose the option to show how the temperature feels, you can't see what the temperature actually is. I'd love to be able to see both at the same time.",FR

"It should be as simple and simple as that. I give it 5 stars despite some shortcomings: 1. It would be nice to sync with the desktop (iCal?) and between devices; 2. It needs reminders and warnings (and due dates, etc.) 3. Any support for longer notes. At the moment, you can edit the item with just a tap on it. Maybe you should double-tap to open the ""details page"" of an item where you can enter the due date, add an alarm or type a longer note. 4. Also sharing a list? It would be great if my wife and I could add shopping lists to each other or just see each other.",FR

"We enjoy this app when you're traveling and ready to eat, this is a great app to find a good place. We've found some really good restaurants that we didn't know a map that takes you there would help, too. A little problem I have is that if you ask what's near you, or if you use a filter, not everything pops up. An example is that I tried to find information about a brewery near our motel. It didn't appear on the map and when I asked for pubs near my current location, it didn't appear in the search, but when I searched by name, there were the pubs and reviews.",PD
"When this app worked, I gave it 4 stars But shortly after I had it, I got several bugs about the inability to synchronize and then I couldn't open all my notes And now it's said, difficulty accessing the evernote server By the way, the solution for this 1 (after I tried to reinstall and restart) is to log in with usernames instead of email (or vice versa) But annoying is that this happens at all. If it works for you, this is a pretty good app that helps you write down all these notes and send yourself in one place by email.",PD
"It freezes almost every day, but not before I have finished a post. For that reason alone, I continue to use it. Unfortunately, it limits my access to parts of the forum that are very useful to me. I can't browse the forum at all. I can't see who started a thread, I can't see autosignatures and I can't use emoticons. Some of my browser shortcuts aren't available. Tapatalk doesn't offer nearly the full browsing experience, but it works and that's enough now.",PD

"Evernote is an excellent and indispensable service in my life I am lucky to be a premium subscriber However, the mobile app seems to be getting worse and worse The latest version is clunky and flawed Not to mention that ""announcements,"" which are essentially advertising, are now occupying the app's main real estate If there was a premium subscription that would allow me to hide them and focus on my work, I would subscribe to them! I love the photo feature I use daily In the latest app iteration, however, this feature causes a crash arg! I am an Evernote evangelist, but I honestly wouldn't recommend this mobile app???

When I download zip files or web pages and open the files, the screen is blank, blackened, or a blurry enlarged image of the icon (from Facebook, Google, or other icons related to the page that the zip file or web page came from when I was a teacher), I rely on online & amp offline access to do research for my work as a teacher, and I need to write notes & amp as zip files to save space.",PD

"Places on maps are incredibly inaccurate Sometimes it's just a few blocks wrong, or maybe a mislabeled street, but I see much worse places outside of San Miguel de Allende within downtown. Do you want to play golf? Come to the Historic Centro, where it's mapped but doesn't exist. The funniest accuracy is the pyramid, which is said to be a few blocks from my rental home. The related problem is the ""Near Me"" feature. Initially, the app couldn't find me. Instead, it thought I was in a city in two hours and showed me sights for that city. As I dragged the map into the city I'm in was more map craziness, but worse. The few places that were accurately mapped were now moved within a block or two of my house. Finally, the new version is less functional than the previous version. And it's much less functional than the site Bottom line, as I delete, at least until this version is resolved, I'm definitely having map problems.",PD

"I'm on a shitty hotel wifi going in and out. I've been trying to download a 1GB file for over 2 days, but for some reason Dropbox hasn't given favored downloads the ability to continue downloading and instead start over every time it fails. It's almost 2014 We have the technology to repeat ONE DOWNLOAD, what's the problem here?",PD
"The notes, bullet points, spacing, and numbering all fail when I transfer them to Word and other systems, resulting in formatting problems that take longer than just starting over and typing in notes. I also notice that the left column flickers and the program crashes on every other use. Approximately one in four synchronization issues an error message. Apart from that, I like to call up notes on my phone, iPad, and desktop (almost) whenever I want. If this problematic version is to get me to choose another version, it is not the case. If this version were more solid, I would be tempted to buy the upgrade.",PD
I can't open it on my iPad 3 Help! Crash! Crash! Crash! Crash! Crash!,PD
"It's Awesome Recently, however, it lapses to receive the message Has not received any notification until you open the app",PD
"Okay, Evernote, I hope you're listening, you had a great idea, but ""Note"" shouldn't be in your name Call it Eversomething Text formatting makes it virtually impossible to create a note with any form of rich text, bullets, numbered lists, indentations, etc. Maybe the underlying code base or architecture makes it difficult to create rich text with proper formatting, I don't know, but until this is fixed, it's not useful And man, I've really tried to like Evernote Synchronization capability across so many platforms has been great, but I need to go back to OneNote now Who knows if you're reading this But I really wish you would understand this tremendous weakness in your product And I've googled a lot to know that I'm not the only one who wants better text functionality Please fix I really want a real Evernote!",PD
"This could be a great app if it was predictable, but it is buggy and unpredictable. If you are able to check in, take a screenshot of your boarding pass or print a backup copy because you may not be able to access it when you need it most.",PD

"In an earlier version, when the user viewed images and suspended the app, he would leave them where they were when the app restarted. Now, the app is completely refreshed on startup, which can be annoying at times. Also, swiping through the images is more cumbersome, as it only responds to the top half of the screen, rather than the entire screen.",PD
"It used to be my most used app, but now it's a problem to find hotels when I'm looking for a geographical location. I now have to enter numerous cities and do numerous searches to find what I'm looking for.",PD
"This is not a review of the Dropbox service (which is great), but of this app, which can use many improvements. Most frustrating of all is that it only displays about a dozen characters in a filename. As I have thousands of files, some of which have long and descriptive names, it is impossible to find what I am looking for, unless I download the files one at a time to the iPad. There is no way to shrink the file list to make more of the files visible. Why not?",PD
"WtfI was happy to pin away when I got an msg telling me that I had reached my pin limit Wtf? Look, if we're going to have limits on what I can pin then I'm going to delete this app and my account That's just stupid Plz fix I love Pinterest but if I can't get the same quality of service I used to, what's the point?",PD
Plz more backgrounds and frames,PD

"It's an amazing app and I love its features, except for one little problem. The GPS feature is a bit away, I'm at home and if I want to make a quick note, it gives me the wrong address. It would be great if this could be fixed.",PD
"It's great when it works, the app separates frequently.",PD
"My iPad air and my iPhone 4 on iOS 7 still don't open page documents, all they show is the document name and size",PD
"I'm totally addicted to it, this is my only app I've had a tiny problem with in such a long time, it freezes, but only once in the blue moon, so it doesn't really bother me # 1 best app, I'm NO JOKE on level 101!!!!!!!",PD
"It may sound like a broken record, but I really like your app when it can be downloaded, but it can't now. I hate having to type that, but it needs to be fixed.",PD
"The offline option always worked great. Don't expect this map to tell you distances from place to place, it won't work, but once you're in a city, if you want to get around, it's hard to beat.",PD
"It used to be a good application with the ability to search and filter for reviews and proximity in cities you have not yet reached, but these features have been replaced by features that focus on marketing hotel concentrations. Do not use this application to buy a good travel guide instead.",PD
"Update, the performance of EN has improved considerably since my last review (from 2 to 3 stars), but the app remains pretty flawed. It constantly reports synchronization errors, freezes for a moment between all actions, crashes here and there, and the search function sometimes doesn't find keywords. I'm borderline and thinking about going premium, but also have an eye for alternatives. Note: Some of my problems might be related to some incompatibility of iPad2 with iOS7Previous review. After several months of daily use and building up about 1K of pretty intense notes, I was about to make a serious long-term commitment to EN - but I had to seriously reconsider this after the problems with the latest upgrade. The problems I experienced are not as severe as what others report, mine were mostly with the iPad 2 version, while the desktop version w MacBook Air continues to work.",PD
"Older versions of this app allowed me to preview Word, Excel and pdf documents while the preview window was still in place. It only tells me the file name and size and does NOT show the contents in a completely useless way.",PD
Cannot simply split the composition due to the file type.,PD
"First of all, let me say that it looks great... if I could manage to get up for more than 5 seconds... then HOLD it! The concept is wonderful and the app seems to be beautifully made from the point of view of the user interface, but it is very unstable. Big disappointment as I use this for my doctoral thesis, big failure in the categories of mobility and comfort... 0 out of 10 for usefulness.",PD
New update gives no details about changes Now the app no longer works Just a black screen with a gray bar at the bottom,PD
The user interface works great and the mapping is nice:) The only bug I've seen is sometimes the Facebook integration.,PD

I like the fact that I can download drop boxes on any device and share images What I don't like is the time it takes to download images and that I always need to be connected to the internet to download them. This keeps the images from downloading a few times when I'm away from Wifi 2613. I'm still trying to find out if images that support the app aren't downloaded and I'll remove this app from my iPad because it's worthless.,PD
"This once great app is now useless, every address I type fails. I was a loyal and constant user before the update, now I'm looking for another app that actually works.",PD
"The forecast is no more specific than a high and low temperature and a picture of the weather for the whole day. Nevertheless, this should not be too detailed, and it offers a lot of information for the current time. My biggest complaint is that the app often crashes at startup. Sometimes it is loaded the second time, sometimes it requires a reboot of my 3rd generation iPad. It is a nice looking app as you would want it on the iPad, it has only one stability problem.",PD
"I called HP to reset the printer, iPad and computer, and even they couldn't figure out what the problem was. After a ton of lost time, I decided to delete the app, and it enabled the iPad to find the printer with AirPrint.

"The only good thing about the last update is the ability to create folders, but you can't create folders within folders. I wish you could. The bad thing about the last update? Now typing has a delay that's very annoying. I don't understand how that happened because there's no crazy graphical user interface or anything animated. The most important thing that's pretty good for most people is removing the TAB key. I always hated that the TAB key was at the top of the ruler. I'd prefer to have just a shift key and place the TAB on the keyboard, but now I wish it was at the top. Now you have to go through a complicated process and menu to use it.

After a modest period of use, the app appears much more stable, but in many ways it still needs to work. The scoring summary is gone (as far as I can tell); I often found this helpful when watching games that I don't follow from game to game. ""Team leaders"" seem to be limited to only one QB (passed), 1 player rushes, and 2 receivers, with no obvious ability to scroll through players or draw a full listing. Especially during preseason games when teams are running through multiple personnel packages, this is very frustrating - there is no way (for example) to compare the passing stats of the 2 or 3 QBs if I have a bigger problem on Thursday, which is not a major one for Dalati.",PD
Always loved Dropbox Reliable and handy Latest version has menu issues Cannot be uploaded Please fix! Thanks!,PD

"UrrrrmAfter my third re-installation, it finally has scenery. Before, it was just black shapes everywhere. I couldn't even see the walls. It killed my internet because it's a very big game that takes half an hour to install - if you don't like the game, you don't have a chance to get a refund. Once I finally got the right game, it's very pretty with smooth graphics, a fantastic soundtrack and some of the best scenes I've ever seen on my tablet. In the next update, I want to see the right rate for the first time, the chance to get a refund and free roam! Free roam was the best part of the old games, I'd love to have it on my tablet!

"We enjoy this app when you're traveling and ready to eat, this is a great app to find a good place. We've found some really good restaurants that we didn't know a map that takes you there would help, too. A little problem I have is that if you ask what's near you, or if you use a filter, not everything pops up. An example is that I tried to find information about a brewery near our motel. It didn't appear on the map and when I asked for pubs near my current location, it didn't appear in the search, but when I searched by name, there were the pubs and reviews.",PD
"When this app worked, I gave it 4 stars But shortly after I had it, I got several bugs about the inability to synchronize and then I couldn't open all my notes And now it's said, difficulty accessing the evernote server By the way, the solution for this 1 (after I tried to reinstall and restart) is to log in with usernames instead of email (or vice versa) But annoying is that this happens at all. If it works for you, this is a pretty good app that helps you write down all these notes and send yourself in one place by email.",PD
"It freezes almost every day, but not before I have finished a post. For that reason alone, I continue to use it. Unfortunately, it limits my access to parts of the forum that are very useful to me. I can't browse the forum at all. I can't see who started a thread, I can't see autosignatures and I can't use emoticons. Some of my browser shortcuts aren't available.

"Places on maps are incredibly inaccurate Sometimes it's just a few blocks wrong, or maybe a mislabeled street, but I see much worse places outside of San Miguel de Allende within downtown. Do you want to play golf? Come to the Historic Centro, where it's mapped but doesn't exist. The funniest accuracy is the pyramid, which is said to be a few blocks from my rental home. The related problem is the ""Near Me"" feature. Initially, the app couldn't find me. Instead, it thought I was in a city in two hours and showed me sights for that city. As I dragged the map into the city I'm in was more map craziness, but worse. The few places that were accurately mapped were now moved within a block or two of my house. Finally, the new version is less functional than the previous version. And it's much less functional than the site Bottom line, as I delete, at least until this version is resolved, I'm definitely having map problems.",PD

"The notes, bullet points, spacing, and numbering all fail when I transfer them to Word and other systems, resulting in formatting problems that take longer than just starting over and typing in notes. I also notice that the left column flickers and the program crashes on every other use. Approximately one in four synchronization issues an error message. Apart from that, I like to call up notes on my phone, iPad, and desktop (almost) whenever I want. If this problematic version is to get me to choose another version, it is not the case. If this version were more solid, I would be tempted to buy the upgrade.",PD

"Okay, Evernote, I hope you're listening, you had a great idea, but ""Note"" shouldn't be in your name Call it Eversomething Text formatting makes it virtually impossible to create a note with any form of rich text, bullets, numbered lists, indentations, etc. Maybe the underlying code base or architecture makes it difficult to create rich text with proper formatting, I don't know, but until this is fixed, it's not useful And man, I've really tried to like Evernote Synchronization capability across so many platforms has been great, but I need to go back to OneNote now Who knows if you're reading this But I really wish you would understand this tremendous weakness in your product And I've googled a lot to know that I'm not the only one who wants better text functionality Please fix I really want a real Evernote!",PD

"In an earlier version, when the user viewed images and suspended the app, he would leave them where they were when the app restarted.

"It used to be my most used app, but now it's a problem to find hotels when I'm looking for a geographical location. I now have to enter numerous cities and do numerous searches to find what I'm looking for.",PD
"This is not a review of the Dropbox service (which is great), but of this app, which can use many improvements. Most frustrating of all is that it only displays about a dozen characters in a filename. As I have thousands of files, some of which have long and descriptive names, it is impossible to find what I am looking for, unless I download the files one at a time to the iPad. There is no way to shrink the file list to make more of the files visible. Why not?",PD
"WtfI was happy to pin away when I got an msg telling me that I had reached my pin limit Wtf? Look, if we're going to have limits on what I can pin then I'm going to delete this app and my account That's just stupid Plz fix I love Pinterest but if I can't get the same quality of service I used to, what's the point?",PD

"I'm totally addicted to it, this is my only app I've had a tiny problem with in such a long time, it freezes, but only once in the blue moon, so it doesn't really bother me # 1 best app, I'm NO JOKE on level 101!!!!!!!",PD
"It may sound like a broken record, but I really like your app when it can be downloaded, but it can't now. I hate having to type that, but it needs to be fixed.",PD
"The offline option always worked great. Don't expect this map to tell you distances from place to place, it won't work, but once you're in a city, if you want to get around, it's hard to beat.",PD
"It used to be a good application with the ability to search and filter for reviews and proximity in cities you have not yet reached, but these features have been replaced by features that focus on marketing hotel concentrations. Do not use this application to buy a good travel guide instead.",PD
"Update, the performance of EN has improved considerably since my last review (from 2 to 3 stars), but the app remains pretty flawed. It constantly reports synchronization errors, freezes for a moment between all actions, crashes here and there, and the search function sometimes doesn't find keywords. I'm borderline and thinking about going premium, but also have an eye for alternatives. Note: Some of my problems might be related to some incompatibility of iPad2 with iOS7Previous review. After several months of daily use and building up about 1K of pretty intense notes, I was about to make a serious long-term commitment to EN - but I had to seriously reconsider this after the problems with the latest upgrade. The problems I experienced are not as severe as what others report, mine were mostly with the iPad 2 version, while the desktop version w MacBook Air continues to work.",PD
"Older versions of this app allowed me to preview Word, Excel and pdf documents while the preview window was still in place. It only tells me the file name and size and does NOT show the contents in a completely useless way.",PD
Cannot simply split the composition due to the file type.,PD
"First of all, let me say that it looks great... if I could manage to get up for more than 5 seconds... then HOLD it! The concept is wonderful and the app seems to be beautifully made from the point of view of the user interface, but it is very unstable. Big disappointment as I use this for my doctoral thesis, big failure in the categories of mobility and comfort... 0 out of 10 for usefulness.",PD
New update gives no details about changes Now the app no longer works Just a black screen with a gray bar at the bottom,PD

I like the fact that I can download drop boxes on any device and share images What I don't like is the time it takes to download images and that I always need to be connected to the internet to download them. This keeps the images from downloading a few times when I'm away from Wifi 2613. I'm still trying to find out if images that support the app aren't downloaded and I'll remove this app from my iPad because it's worthless.,PD

"The forecast is no more specific than a high and low temperature and a picture of the weather for the whole day. Nevertheless, this should not be too detailed, and it offers a lot of information for the current time. My biggest complaint is that the app often crashes at startup. Sometimes it is loaded the second time, sometimes it requires a reboot of my 3rd generation iPad. It is a nice looking app as you would want it on the iPad, it has only one stability problem.",PD
"I called HP to reset the printer, iPad and computer, and even they couldn't figure out what the problem was. After a ton of lost time, I decided to delete the app, and it enabled the iPad to find the printer with AirPrint.

"The only good thing about the last update is the ability to create folders, but you can't create folders within folders. I wish you could. The bad thing about the last update? Now typing has a delay that's very annoying. I don't understand how that happened because there's no crazy graphical user interface or anything animated. The most important thing that's pretty good for most people is removing the TAB key. I always hated that the TAB key was at the top of the ruler. I'd prefer to have just a shift key and place the TAB on the keyboard, but now I wish it was at the top. Now you have to go through a complicated process and menu to use it.

However, there is still a problem that is that when you try to use the ""Open in"" option in other iPad applications and prompt Dropbox to open, the just opened file appears in the iPad Dropbox application, but the Dropbox server is not updated, which means that the file is not found in the Dropbox folders when you access the folders from another computer, etc.",PD

"I give the NFL '12 v3 update three stars, largely because it's an improvement over the previous version, the in-game display is better organized, and the ""scores"" page is far superior to the previous version in many ways: you can now see all the games of the current week on one screen instead of scrolling through a list. After a modest period of use, the app appears much more stable, but in many ways it still needs to work. The scoring summary is gone (as far as I can tell); I often found this helpful when watching games that I don't follow from game to game. ""Team leaders"" seem to be limited to only one QB (passed), 1 player rushes, and 2 receivers, with no obvious ability to scroll through players or draw a full listing. Especially during preseason games when teams are running through multiple personnel packages, this is very frustrating - there is no way (for example) to compare the passing stats of the 2 or 3 QBs if I have a bigger problem on Thursday, which is not a major one for Dalati.",PD

Once I finally got the right game, it's very pretty with smooth graphics, a fantastic soundtrack and some of the best scenes I've ever seen on my tablet.

The only thing is that my app crashes every time I try to select information for a planet. Maybe it's because the brand new iOS 4 needs ONE UPDATE!!!,PD
"I love pinning! I love Pintrest and this app allows me to use it anywhere. The only problem I had is that if I turn my phone sideways, the screen gets messed up and I have to get out of the repair!",PD
"Even though I'm an avid pinner, this app keeps getting me out of my pinning time, so my search has to start all over again. It's very irritating, and it also slows down a ton when I open another board next to my own. Please fix these problems! I want more pins!",PD
Since the update I can no longer open links or images by e-mail.,PD
"Every time I log into my TripAdvisor account via Facebook on my iPod Touch, it crashes, I can only log in via my Facebook, but it won't let me in. This glitch needs to be fixed",PD
"Music takes 15 seconds to load after you select a song (whether I'm on Verizon LTE or Wifi), it doesn't automatically play the next song, but you need to open the app, go back and select the next song in the folder. You can't even press the ""next"" button to skip tracks Please fix these issues in the next update!",PD
"We enjoy this app when you're traveling and ready to eat, this is a great app to find a good place. We've found some really good restaurants that we didn't know a map that takes you there would help, too. A little problem I have is that if you ask what's near you, or if you use a filter, not everything pops up. An example is that I tried to find information about a brewery near our motel. It didn't appear on the map and when I asked for pubs near my current location, it didn't appear in the search, but when I searched by name, there were the pubs and reviews.",PD
"When this app worked, I gave it 4 stars But shortly after I had it, I got several bugs about the inability to synchronize and then I couldn't open all my notes And now it's said, difficulty accessing the evernote server By the way, the solution for this 1 (after I tried to reinstall and restart) is to log in with usernames instead of email (or vice versa) But annoying is that this happens at all. If it works for you, this is a pretty good app that helps you write down all these notes and send yourself in one place by email.",PD
"It freezes almost every day, but not before I have finished a post. For that reason alone, I continue to use it. Unfortunately, it limits my access to parts of the forum that are very useful to me. I can't browse the forum at all. I can't see who started a thread, I can't see autosignatures and I can't use emoticons. Some of my browser shortcuts aren't available. Tapatalk doesn't offer nearly the full browsing experience, but it works and that's enough now.",PD
Give me an error the first time after uploading check images. App crashed the second time when uploading check images.,PD
"Most hotel reviews, especially of bad hotels, are fake and are most likely posted by staff. Note that a negative review is inevitably followed by several glowing reviews, and since TripAdvisor is paid by the hotels listed on this page, negative reviews are removed under pressure from the hotel.",PD
BetterEm with Samsung Galaxy s 4 ad I face a problem when I update what appplz fix it,PD
"Evernote is an excellent and indispensable service in my life I am lucky to be a premium subscriber However, the mobile app seems to be getting worse and worse The latest version is clunky and flawed Not to mention that ""announcements,"" which are essentially advertising, are now occupying the app's main real estate If there was a premium subscription that would allow me to hide them and focus on my work, I would subscribe to them! I love the photo feature I use daily In the latest app iteration, however, this feature causes a crash arg! I am an Evernote evangelist, but I honestly wouldn't recommend this mobile app??? ORIGINAL REVIEWThanks for your hard work Happy to be a premium subscriberOnly suggestion add ability to copy note links?",PD
"None of my photos get uploaded, even though they've been uploaded to Dropbox for months. Since the update, none of my photos have appeared in Dropbox. It's just a white box app that won't help me if it doesn't load my photos.",PD

Can't even upload a file from pages,PD
I loved SoundHound before the last update. Now I can't see my story anymore. I tried it several times and after 30 minutes waiting for the download I just give up. Back to using Shazam. I hope this will be fixed.,PD
Easily installed update and it is now unusable because it crashes on startup in 100% of cases,PD
"I have not given permission to upload images The settings say so, but it will continue to STOP uploading!!!",PD
This app is terrible in my experience. It takes ages to load and search and filter options either fail completely or partially. I have returned to the TripAdvisor website via my browser.,PD
Files not marked with stars occupied more than 600 MB and I have no way to reduce them as they consume my entire ipad space.,PD
Cannot open any saved files,PD

"Great app, but I wish I could move pins from one board to another, in bulk rather than individually. If I'm editing my boards, it takes too long to move pin after pin.",PD
Be good until I can't open any more office documents,PD
"The white app icon is so ghastly, I hide it in a new folder that I call it ""Ugly Apps."" It's joined by photos and iBooks. Some other Apple bloat-ware apps like Game Center, Newsstand and Passbook could also be added, but they'll stay in my ""Crap!"" folder instead.",PD
So frustrated. Unresponsive or sluggish. Can't change the city I want to rent from. I give up.,PD
"Search engine not complete Search for vacation rentals in Healdsburg, CA I have friends there and know there are more than 16 B & Amp.

"The only thing that's good for is starting documents. When you try to upload your documents from Google documents, the document is just gray.",PD
"It was cool until the last update where I can't upload from my iPhone now. It starts uploading, the progress bar indicates that it works, then when the radionics is running, the progress bar just starts over and over again, over and over again.",PD
App has not worked for a month. That shows no effort in trying to fix this. They all failed.,PD
Why run at startup?? Obtain unnecessary permissions Also I do not want the app to run at startup! I would rather uninstall this,PD
"I've always found Dropbox to be a bit faulty, but it's gotten worse since I upgraded to iOS 7. When I download zip files or web pages and open the files, the screen is blank, blackened, or a blurry enlarged image of the icon (from Facebook, Google, or other icons related to the page that the zip file or web page came from when I was a teacher), I rely on online & amp offline access to do research for my work as a teacher, and I need to write notes & amp as zip files to save space.",PD
"Hi Fox, would you help me with my Fox News app, it's as ""frozen"" as ice. I can't even write you except through this review. This is the first time it's happened to me at Fox, so I'm leaving 4 stars;) TY in advance!! I'm on an iPod 4 with wifi.",PD

"I had this program for 2 months, had a lot of very important information inside, picturesque notes, etc. Suddenly, while I was using it, it broke on me and when I came back in, everything was gone! I use an IPad 2 with a lot of memory, had no other programs that even suggested a conflict! DO NOT USE THIS IF YOU TRUST IMPORTANT IMPORTANT DOCUMENT information, I am very computer savvy This program is fraught with problems, even if you continue to download all the 'fixes' there.",PD
"I tried it this morning before I showed it to my daughter and it crashes 3 seconds after I tried to open it. Unfortunately, I didn't read the reviews before I bought it because it sounds like it would happen to anyone. I want my money back.",PD

"The game is very good, the graphics are great, I loved it. The app is really smooth. I just wish the upgrades were permanent and the customization would be more like the original, most wanted and free roam feature. The rest is perfect.",PD
"I really need to know how far a restaurant is from my current location, so I don't have to take a taxi from the hotel or fight the traffic. I want to know what's near me. Too bad it has what it takes to make a great app!!!",PD
"Agree with the recent reviewers - this update has completely ruined this great app for the iPhone on IOS7. Doesn't work on all openings, then freezes completely and can't even open my notes or create new ones.",PD

"I love this app It helps me a lot when I'm traveling, but one thing makes me angry is that when I click to see the photos, it only shows 1 image and I get stuck, I have to delete the app and download it again??????",PD
Then you have to go back to the search and zoom in from a global perspective.,PD
The only problem I had was one of the supplied sources that crashed the program.,PD
You need to improve the Hebrew editing.,PD

"Places on maps are incredibly inaccurate Sometimes it's just a few blocks wrong, or maybe a mislabeled street, but I see much worse places outside of San Miguel de Allende within downtown. Do you want to play golf? Come to the Historic Centro, where it's mapped but doesn't exist. The funniest accuracy is the pyramid, which is said to be a few blocks from my rental home. The related problem is the ""Near Me"" feature. Initially, the app couldn't find me. Instead, it thought I was in a city in two hours and showed me sights for that city. As I dragged the map into the city I'm in was more map craziness, but worse. The few places that were accurately mapped were now moved within a block or two of my house. Finally, the new version is less functional than the previous version. And it's much less functional than the site Bottom line, as I delete, at least until this version is resolved, I'm definitely having map problems.",PD
"This app is not so great that it doesn't play Flash videos at first. It's terrible, it keeps coming up that my connection is bad when I have full bars that are slow and crash.",PD
I have problems moving my files,PD
"horrible appI uploaded HUNDREDS of photos, but app couldn't upload them alllost hundreds of precious memories of concerts, times with friends, etc. I SHOULD have to rely on this app I had NO backup for these photos and deleted them when they said they were done now they are gone, I can't access them",PD
"No notes that show up All notebooks are there, but they are all empty Boo",PD
"I love pintrest Super funny ideas and the app works best when time sometimes reels, but not very often",PD
"I'm on a shitty hotel wifi going in and out. I've been trying to download a 1GB file for over 2 days, but for some reason Dropbox hasn't given favored downloads the ability to continue downloading and instead start over every time it fails. It's almost 2014 We have the technology to repeat ONE DOWNLOAD, what's the problem here?",PD
"The notes, bullet points, spacing, and numbering all fail when I transfer them to Word and other systems, resulting in formatting problems that take longer than just starting over and typing in notes. I also notice that the left column flickers and the program crashes on every other use. Approximately one in four synchronization issues an error message. Apart from that, I like to call up notes on my phone, iPad, and desktop (almost) whenever I want. If this problematic version is to get me to choose another version, it is not the case. If this version were more solid, I would be tempted to buy the upgrade.",PD
I can't open it on my iPad 3 Help! Crash! Crash! Crash! Crash! Crash!,PD
"It's Awesome Recently, however, it lapses to receive the message Has not received any notification until you open the app",PD
"Okay, Evernote, I hope you're listening, you had a great idea, but ""Note"" shouldn't be in your name Call it Eversomething Text formatting makes it virtually impossible to create a note with any form of rich text, bullets, numbered lists, indentations, etc. Maybe the underlying code base or architecture makes it difficult to create rich text with proper formatting, I don't know, but until this is fixed, it's not useful And man, I've really tried to like Evernote Synchronization capability across so many platforms has been great, but I need to go back to OneNote now Who knows if you're reading this But I really wish you would understand this tremendous weakness in your product And I've googled a lot to know that I'm not the only one who wants better text functionality Please fix I really want a real Evernote!",PD
"This could be a great app if it was predictable, but it is buggy and unpredictable. If you are able to check in, take a screenshot of your boarding pass or print a backup copy because you may not be able to access it when you need it most.",PD
Until the last update Please fix,PD
The app allows me to manage my trip directly on my phone Perfectly handy But the performance is not smooth at all The app needs to fix random crashes and faulty performance,PD
"Need to improve the functionality of this app Can't vote reviews helpfulCan't read your own posts or see badgesHave to scroll through all the pictures to get to the end Would be nice if you could skip to the oldest latest pictures without having to scroll through each one Back button needs to work, otherwise good for the basics!",PD
"In an earlier version, when the user viewed images and suspended the app, he would leave them where they were when the app restarted. Now, the app is completely refreshed on startup, which can be annoying at times. Also, swiping through the images is more cumbersome, as it only responds to the top half of the screen, rather than the entire screen.",PD
"It used to be my most used app, but now it's a problem to find hotels when I'm looking for a geographical location. I now have to enter numerous cities and do numerous searches to find what I'm looking for.",PD
"This is not a review of the Dropbox service (which is great), but of this app, which can use many improvements. Most frustrating of all is that it only displays about a dozen characters in a filename. As I have thousands of files, some of which have long and descriptive names, it is impossible to find what I am looking for, unless I download the files one at a time to the iPad. There is no way to shrink the file list to make more of the files visible. Why not?",PD
"WtfI was happy to pin away when I got an msg telling me that I had reached my pin limit Wtf? Look, if we're going to have limits on what I can pin then I'm going to delete this app and my account That's just stupid Plz fix I love Pinterest but if I can't get the same quality of service I used to, what's the point?",PD
Plz more backgrounds and frames,PD
"ok seriously, this app would be great if the timing adjustments weren't so erratic. I've done the same exact video a million times and it always comes out with an extra 2 seconds here or a little bit shorter and throws out all the video / audio synchronization.",PD
"The last update downloaded, and now my app is gone, and the App Store no longer lets me download it.",PD
"Sometime last month Dropbox stopped syncing The newest files on my phone are all 1 month old, but there are many more current files that I have loaded into the Dropbox desktop folder to sync the help!",PD
"It's an amazing app and I love its features, except for one little problem. The GPS feature is a bit away, I'm at home and if I want to make a quick note, it gives me the wrong address. It would be great if this could be fixed.",PD
"It's great when it works, the app separates frequently.",PD
"My iPad air and my iPhone 4 on iOS 7 still don't open page documents, all they show is the document name and size",PD
"I'm totally addicted to it, this is my only app I've had a tiny problem with in such a long time, it freezes, but only once in the blue moon, so it doesn't really bother me # 1 best app, I'm NO JOKE on level 101!!!!!!!",PD
"It may sound like a broken record, but I really like your app when it can be downloaded, but it can't now. I hate having to type that, but it needs to be fixed.",PD
"The offline option always worked great. Don't expect this map to tell you distances from place to place, it won't work, but once you're in a city, if you want to get around, it's hard to beat.",PD
"It used to be a good application with the ability to search and filter for reviews and proximity in cities you have not yet reached, but these features have been replaced by features that focus on marketing hotel concentrations. Do not use this application to buy a good travel guide instead.",PD
"Update, the performance of EN has improved considerably since my last review (from 2 to 3 stars), but the app remains pretty flawed. It constantly reports synchronization errors, freezes for a moment between all actions, crashes here and there, and the search function sometimes doesn't find keywords. I'm borderline and thinking about going premium, but also have an eye for alternatives. Note: Some of my problems might be related to some incompatibility of iPad2 with iOS7Previous review. After several months of daily use and building up about 1K of pretty intense notes, I was about to make a serious long-term commitment to EN - but I had to seriously reconsider this after the problems with the latest upgrade. The problems I experienced are not as severe as what others report, mine were mostly with the iPad 2 version, while the desktop version w MacBook Air continues to work.",PD
"Older versions of this app allowed me to preview Word, Excel and pdf documents while the preview window was still in place. It only tells me the file name and size and does NOT show the contents in a completely useless way.",PD
Cannot simply split the composition due to the file type.,PD
"First of all, let me say that it looks great... if I could manage to get up for more than 5 seconds... then HOLD it! The concept is wonderful and the app seems to be beautifully made from the point of view of the user interface, but it is very unstable. Big disappointment as I use this for my doctoral thesis, big failure in the categories of mobility and comfort... 0 out of 10 for usefulness.",PD
New update gives no details about changes Now the app no longer works Just a black screen with a gray bar at the bottom,PD
The user interface works great and the mapping is nice:) The only bug I've seen is sometimes the Facebook integration.,PD
"Im a dudeIm a dude and i love pinterest The app is little glitchie on Android and iPhone, but it's getting better",PD

I use ipad mini But I can't even access my account because the app crashes iPhone size every time I open it,PD
I like the fact that I can download drop boxes on any device and share images What I don't like is the time it takes to download images and that I always need to be connected to the internet to download them. This keeps the images from downloading a few times when I'm away from Wifi 2613. I'm still trying to find out if images that support the app aren't downloaded and I'll remove this app from my iPad because it's worthless.,PD
"This once great app is now useless, every address I type fails. I was a loyal and constant user before the update, now I'm looking for another app that actually works.",PD
"The forecast is no more specific than a high and low temperature and a picture of the weather for the whole day. Nevertheless, this should not be too detailed, and it offers a lot of information for the current time. My biggest complaint is that the app often crashes at startup. Sometimes it is loaded the second time, sometimes it requires a reboot of my 3rd generation iPad. It is a nice looking app as you would want it on the iPad, it has only one stability problem.",PD
"I called HP to reset the printer, iPad and computer, and even they couldn't figure out what the problem was. After a ton of lost time, I decided to delete the app, and it enabled the iPad to find the printer with AirPrint. This app requires a lot of work, so I would be extremely careful when downloading at this time. A waste of time!",PD

The search function does not work and I have to log in every time I open it. Evernote needs to fix this problem.,PD
"For me, functionality is more important than appearance, so this review says nothing about the updated look. There are some big problems with the update!!!! I no longer have the ability to open ""in.""

"The only good thing about the last update is the ability to create folders, but you can't create folders within folders. I wish you could. The bad thing about the last update? Now typing has a delay that's very annoying. I don't understand how that happened because there's no crazy graphical user interface or anything animated. The most important thing that's pretty good for most people is removing the TAB key. I always hated that the TAB key was at the top of the ruler. I'd prefer to have just a shift key and place the TAB on the keyboard, but now I wish it was at the top. Now you have to go through a complicated process and menu to use it. I've stopped using Pages now because it's so painful to press it when you're not using Bluetooth keyboard.",PD

However, there is still a problem that is that when you try to use the ""Open in"" option in other iPad applications and prompt Dropbox to open, the just opened file appears in the iPad Dropbox application, but the Dropbox server is not updated, which means that the file is not found in the Dropbox folders when you access the folders from another computer, etc.",PD

Please fix it. The ""GROUP by PODCAST"" button is dead now after I successfully created ONE playlist.... I uninstalled, reinstalled, restarted my iPhone, etc. Please help... a great program otherwise. I only have a lot of podcasts and need to be able to group them... the fixed video app of the iPhone does that for me... but I really want to use your program compared to the iPhone app.... please advise.",PD

"I give the NFL '12 v3 update three stars, largely because it's an improvement over the previous version, the in-game display is better organized, and the ""scores"" page is far superior to the previous version in many ways: you can now see all the games of the current week on one screen instead of scrolling through a list. After a modest period of use, the app appears much more stable, but in many ways it still needs to work. The scoring summary is gone (as far as I can tell); I often found this helpful when watching games that I don't follow from game to game. ""Team leaders"" seem to be limited to only one QB (passed), 1 player rushes, and 2 receivers, with no obvious ability to scroll through players or draw a full listing. Especially during preseason games when teams are running through multiple personnel packages, this is very frustrating - there is no way (for example) to compare the passing stats of the 2 or 3 QBs if I have a bigger problem on Thursday, which is not a major one for Dalati.",PD
Always loved Dropbox Reliable and handy Latest version has menu issues Cannot be uploaded Please fix! Thanks!,PD

"UrrrrmAfter my third re-installation, it finally has scenery. Before, it was just black shapes everywhere. I couldn't even see the walls. It killed my internet because it's a very big game that takes half an hour to install - if you don't like the game, you don't have a chance to get a refund. Once I finally got the right game, it's very pretty with smooth graphics, a fantastic soundtrack and some of the best scenes I've ever seen on my tablet. In the next update, I want to see the right rate for the first time, the chance to get a refund and free roam! Free roam was the best part of the old games, I'd love to have it on my tablet!

"We enjoy this app when you're traveling and ready to eat, this is a great app to find a good place. We've found some really good restaurants that we didn't know a map that takes you there would help, too. A little problem I have is that if you ask what's near you, or if you use a filter, not everything pops up. An example is that I tried to find information about a brewery near our motel.

"When this app worked, I gave it 4 stars But shortly after I had it, I got several bugs about the inability to synchronize and then I couldn't open all my notes And now it's said, difficulty accessing the evernote server By the way, the solution for this 1 (after I tried to reinstall and restart) is to log in with usernames instead of email (or vice versa) But annoying is that this happens at all. If it works for you, this is a pretty good app that helps you write down all these notes and send yourself in one place by email.",PD
"It freezes almost every day, but not before I have finished a post. For that reason alone, I continue to use it. Unfortunately, it limits my access to parts of the forum that are very useful to me. I can't browse the forum at all. I can't see who started a thread, I can't see autosignatures and I can't use emoticons. Some of my browser shortcuts aren't available.

"Places on maps are incredibly inaccurate Sometimes it's just a few blocks wrong, or maybe a mislabeled street, but I see much worse places outside of San Miguel de Allende within downtown. Do you want to play golf? Come to the Historic Centro, where it's mapped but doesn't exist. The funniest accuracy is the pyramid, which is said to be a few blocks from my rental home. The related problem is the ""Near Me"" feature. Initially, the app couldn't find me. Instead, it thought I was in a city in two hours and showed me sights for that city. As I dragged the map into the city I'm in was more map craziness, but worse. The few places that were accurately mapped were now moved within a block or two of my house. Finally, the new version is less functional than the previous version. And it's much less functional than the site Bottom line, as I delete, at least until this version is resolved, I'm definitely having map problems.",PD

"The notes, bullet points, spacing, and numbering all fail when I transfer them to Word and other systems, resulting in formatting problems that take longer than just starting over and typing in notes. I also notice that the left column flickers and the program crashes on every other use. Approximately one in four synchronization issues an error message. Apart from that, I like to call up notes on my phone, iPad, and desktop (almost) whenever I want. If this problematic version is to get me to choose another version, it is not the case.

"Okay, Evernote, I hope you're listening, you had a great idea, but ""Note"" shouldn't be in your name Call it Eversomething Text formatting makes it virtually impossible to create a note with any form of rich text, bullets, numbered lists, indentations, etc. Maybe the underlying code base or architecture makes it difficult to create rich text with proper formatting, I don't know, but until this is fixed, it's not useful And man, I've really tried to like Evernote Synchronization capability across so many platforms has been great, but I need to go back to OneNote now Who knows if you're reading this But I really wish you would understand this tremendous weakness in your product And I've googled a lot to know that I'm not the only one who wants better text functionality Please fix I really want a real Evernote!",PD
"This could be a great app if it was predictable, but it is buggy and unpredictable. If you are able to check in, take a screenshot of your boarding pass or print a backup copy because you may not be able to access it when you need it most.",PD

The app allows me to manage my trip directly on my phone Perfectly handy But the performance is not smooth at all The app needs to fix random crashes and faulty performance,PD

"In an earlier version, when the user viewed images and suspended the app, he would leave them where they were when the app restarted. Now, the app is completely refreshed on startup, which can be annoying at times. Also, swiping through the images is more cumbersome, as it only responds to the top half of the screen, rather than the entire screen.",PD
"It used to be my most used app, but now it's a problem to find hotels when I'm looking for a geographical location. I now have to enter numerous cities and do numerous searches to find what I'm looking for.",PD
"This is not a review of the Dropbox service (which is great), but of this app, which can use many improvements. Most frustrating of all is that it only displays about a dozen characters in a filename. As I have thousands of files, some of which have long and descriptive names, it is impossible to find what I am looking for, unless I download the files one at a time to the iPad. There is no way to shrink the file list to make more of the files visible. Why not?",PD
"WtfI was happy to pin away when I got an msg telling me that I had reached my pin limit Wtf? Look, if we're going to have limits on what I can pin then I'm going to delete this app and my account That's just stupid Plz fix I love Pinterest but if I can't get the same quality of service I used to, what's the point?",PD
Plz more backgrounds and frames,PD
"ok seriously, this app would be great if the timing adjustments weren't so erratic. I've done the same exact video a million times and it always comes out with an extra 2 seconds here or a little bit shorter and throws out all the video / audio synchronization.",PD

"My iPad air and my iPhone 4 on iOS 7 still don't open page documents, all they show is the document name and size",PD
"I'm totally addicted to it, this is my only app I've had a tiny problem with in such a long time, it freezes, but only once in the blue moon, so it doesn't really bother me # 1 best app, I'm NO JOKE on level 101!!!!!!!",PD
"It may sound like a broken record, but I really like your app when it can be downloaded, but it can't now. I hate having to type that, but it needs to be fixed.",PD
"The offline option always worked great. Don't expect this map to tell you distances from place to place, it won't work, but once you're in a city, if you want to get around, it's hard to beat.",PD
"It used to be a good application with the ability to search and filter for reviews and proximity in cities you have not yet reached, but these features have been replaced by features that focus on marketing hotel concentrations. Do not use this application to buy a good travel guide instead.",PD
"Update, the performance of EN has improved considerably since my last review (from 2 to 3 stars), but the app remains pretty flawed. It constantly reports synchronization errors, freezes for a moment between all actions, crashes here and there, and the search function sometimes doesn't find keywords. I'm borderline and thinking about going premium, but also have an eye for alternatives. Note: Some of my problems might be related to some incompatibility of iPad2 with iOS7Previous review. After several months of daily use and building up about 1K of pretty intense notes, I was about to make a serious long-term commitment to EN - but I had to seriously reconsider this after the problems with the latest upgrade. The problems I experienced are not as severe as what others report, mine were mostly with the iPad 2 version, while the desktop version w MacBook Air continues to work.",PD
"Older versions of this app allowed me to preview Word, Excel and pdf documents while the preview window was still in place. It only tells me the file name and size and does NOT show the contents in a completely useless way.",PD
Cannot simply split the composition due to the file type.,PD
"First of all, let me say that it looks great... if I could manage to get up for more than 5 seconds... then HOLD it! The concept is wonderful and the app seems to be beautifully made from the point of view of the user interface, but it is very unstable. Big disappointment as I use this for my doctoral thesis, big failure in the categories of mobility and comfort... 0 out of 10 for usefulness.",PD
New update gives no details about changes Now the app no longer works Just a black screen with a gray bar at the bottom,PD
The user interface works great and the mapping is nice:) The only bug I've seen is sometimes the Facebook integration.,PD

I like the fact that I can download drop boxes on any device and share images What I don't like is the time it takes to download images and that I always need to be connected to the internet to download them. This keeps the images from downloading a few times when I'm away from Wifi 2613. I'm still trying to find out if images that support the app aren't downloaded and I'll remove this app from my iPad because it's worthless.,PD
"This once great app is now useless, every address I type fails. I was a loyal and constant user before the update, now I'm looking for another app that actually works.",PD
"The forecast is no more specific than a high and low temperature and a picture of the weather for the whole day. Nevertheless, this should not be too detailed, and it offers a lot of information for the current time. My biggest complaint is that the app often crashes at startup. Sometimes it is loaded the second time, sometimes it requires a reboot of my 3rd generation iPad. It is a nice looking app as you would want it on the iPad, it has only one stability problem.",PD
"I called HP to reset the printer, iPad and computer, and even they couldn't figure out what the problem was. After a ton of lost time, I decided to delete the app, and it enabled the iPad to find the printer with AirPrint. This app requires a lot of work, so I would be extremely careful when downloading at this time. A waste of time!",PD

"The only good thing about the last update is the ability to create folders, but you can't create folders within folders. I wish you could. The bad thing about the last update? Now typing has a delay that's very annoying. I don't understand how that happened because there's no crazy graphical user interface or anything animated. The most important thing that's pretty good for most people is removing the TAB key. I always hated that the TAB key was at the top of the ruler. I'd prefer to have just a shift key and place the TAB on the keyboard, but now I wish it was at the top. Now you have to go through a complicated process and menu to use it. I've stopped using Pages now because it's so painful to press it when you're not using Bluetooth keyboard.",PD

"The latest update has fixed the issue of crashes and can view the pdfs thanks to your work without any problems! However, there is still a problem that is that when you try to use the ""Open in"" option in other iPad applications and prompt Dropbox to open, the just opened file appears in the iPad Dropbox application, but the Dropbox server is not updated, which means that the file is not found in the Dropbox folders when you access the folders from another computer, etc.",PD

"I give the NFL '12 v3 update three stars, largely because it's an improvement over the previous version, the in-game display is better organized, and the ""scores"" page is far superior to the previous version in many ways: you can now see all the games of the current week on one screen instead of scrolling through a list. After a modest period of use, the app appears much more stable, but in many ways it still needs to work. The scoring summary is gone (as far as I can tell); I often found this helpful when watching games that I don't follow from game to game. ""Team leaders"" seem to be limited to only one QB (passed), 1 player rushes, and 2 receivers, with no obvious ability to scroll through players or draw a full listing. Especially during preseason games when teams are running through multiple personnel packages, this is very frustrating - there is no way (for example) to compare the passing stats of the 2 or 3 QBs if I have a bigger problem on Thursday, which is not a major one for Dalati.",PD

Once I finally got the right game, it's very pretty with smooth graphics, a fantastic soundtrack and some of the best scenes I've ever seen on my tablet.

"We enjoy this app when you're traveling and ready to eat, this is a great app to find a good place. We've found some really good restaurants that we didn't know a map that takes you there would help, too. A little problem I have is that if you ask what's near you, or if you use a filter, not everything pops up. An example is that I tried to find information about a brewery near our motel. It didn't appear on the map and when I asked for pubs near my current location, it didn't appear in the search, but when I searched by name, there were the pubs and reviews.",PD
"When this app worked, I gave it 4 stars But shortly after I had it, I got several bugs about the inability to synchronize and then I couldn't open all my notes And now it's said, difficulty accessing the evernote server By the way, the solution for this 1 (after I tried to reinstall and restart) is to log in with usernames instead of email (or vice versa) But annoying is that this happens at all.

"Places on maps are incredibly inaccurate Sometimes it's just a few blocks wrong, or maybe a mislabeled street, but I see much worse places outside of San Miguel de Allende within downtown. Do you want to play golf? Come to the Historic Centro, where it's mapped but doesn't exist. The funniest accuracy is the pyramid, which is said to be a few blocks from my rental home. The related problem is the ""Near Me"" feature. Initially, the app couldn't find me. Instead, it thought I was in a city in two hours and showed me sights for that city. As I dragged the map into the city I'm in was more map craziness, but worse. The few places that were accurately mapped were now moved within a block or two of my house. Finally, the new version is less functional than the previous version. And it's much less functional than the site Bottom line, as I delete, at least until this version is resolved, I'm definitely having map problems.",PD

"I'm on a shitty hotel wifi going in and out. I've been trying to download a 1GB file for over 2 days, but for some reason Dropbox hasn't given favored downloads the ability to continue downloading and instead start over every time it fails.

"The notes, bullet points, spacing, and numbering all fail when I transfer them to Word and other systems, resulting in formatting problems that take longer than just starting over and typing in notes. I also notice that the left column flickers and the program crashes on every other use. Approximately one in four synchronization issues an error message. Apart from that, I like to call up notes on my phone, iPad, and desktop (almost) whenever I want. If this problematic version is to get me to choose another version, it is not the case. If this version were more solid, I would be tempted to buy the upgrade.",PD
I can't open it on my iPad 3 Help! Crash! Crash! Crash! Crash! Crash!,PD
"It's Awesome Recently, however, it lapses to receive the message Has not received any notification until you open the app",PD
"Okay, Evernote, I hope you're listening, you had a great idea, but ""Note"" shouldn't be in your name Call it Eversomething Text formatting makes it virtually impossible to create a note with any form of rich text, bullets, numbered lists, indentations, etc. Maybe the underlying code base or architecture makes it difficult to create rich text with proper formatting, I don't know, but until this is fixed, it's not useful And man, I've really tried to like Evernote Synchronization capability across so many platforms has been great, but I need to go back to OneNote now Who knows if you're reading this But I really wish you would understand this tremendous weakness in your product And I've googled a lot to know that I'm not the only one who wants better text functionality Please fix I really want a real Evernote!",PD
"This could be a great app if it was predictable, but it is buggy and unpredictable. If you are able to check in, take a screenshot of your boarding pass or print a backup copy because you may not be able to access it when you need it most.",PD

"In an earlier version, when the user viewed images and suspended the app, he would leave them where they were when the app restarted. Now, the app is completely refreshed on startup, which can be annoying at times. Also, swiping through the images is more cumbersome, as it only responds to the top half of the screen, rather than the entire screen.",PD
"It used to be my most used app, but now it's a problem to find hotels when I'm looking for a geographical location. I now have to enter numerous cities and do numerous searches to find what I'm looking for.",PD
"This is not a review of the Dropbox service (which is great), but of this app, which can use many improvements. Most frustrating of all is that it only displays about a dozen characters in a filename. As I have thousands of files, some of which have long and descriptive names, it is impossible to find what I am looking for, unless I download the files one at a time to the iPad. There is no way to shrink the file list to make more of the files visible. Why not?",PD
"WtfI was happy to pin away when I got an msg telling me that I had reached my pin limit Wtf? Look, if we're going to have limits on what I can pin then I'm going to delete this app and my account That's just stupid Plz fix I love Pinterest but if I can't get the same quality of service I used to, what's the point?",PD
Plz more backgrounds and frames,PD

"It may sound like a broken record, but I really like your app when it can be downloaded, but it can't now. I hate having to type that, but it needs to be fixed.",PD
"The offline option always worked great. Don't expect this map to tell you distances from place to place, it won't work, but once you're in a city, if you want to get around, it's hard to beat.",PD
"It used to be a good application with the ability to search and filter for reviews and proximity in cities you have not yet reached, but these features have been replaced by features that focus on marketing hotel concentrations. Do not use this application to buy a good travel guide instead.",PD
"Update, the performance of EN has improved considerably since my last review (from 2 to 3 stars), but the app remains pretty flawed. It constantly reports synchronization errors, freezes for a moment between all actions, crashes here and there, and the search function sometimes doesn't find keywords. I'm borderline and thinking about going premium, but also have an eye for alternatives. Note: Some of my problems might be related to some incompatibility of iPad2 with iOS7Previous review. After several months of daily use and building up about 1K of pretty intense notes, I was about to make a serious long-term commitment to EN - but I had to seriously reconsider this after the problems with the latest upgrade. The problems I experienced are not as severe as what others report, mine were mostly with the iPad 2 version, while the desktop version w MacBook Air continues to work.",PD
"Older versions of this app allowed me to preview Word, Excel and pdf documents while the preview window was still in place. It only tells me the file name and size and does NOT show the contents in a completely useless way.",PD
Cannot simply split the composition due to the file type.,PD
"First of all, let me say that it looks great... if I could manage to get up for more than 5 seconds... then HOLD it! The concept is wonderful and the app seems to be beautifully made from the point of view of the user interface, but it is very unstable. Big disappointment as I use this for my doctoral thesis, big failure in the categories of mobility and comfort... 0 out of 10 for usefulness.",PD
New update gives no details about changes Now the app no longer works Just a black screen with a gray bar at the bottom,PD
The user interface works great and the mapping is nice:) The only bug I've seen is sometimes the Facebook integration.,PD

I like the fact that I can download drop boxes on any device and share images What I don't like is the time it takes to download images and that I always need to be connected to the internet to download them. This keeps the images from downloading a few times when I'm away from Wifi 2613. I'm still trying to find out if images that support the app aren't downloaded and I'll remove this app from my iPad because it's worthless.,PD
"This once great app is now useless, every address I type fails. I was a loyal and constant user before the update, now I'm looking for another app that actually works.",PD
"The forecast is no more specific than a high and low temperature and a picture of the weather for the whole day. Nevertheless, this should not be too detailed, and it offers a lot of information for the current time. My biggest complaint is that the app often crashes at startup. Sometimes it is loaded the second time, sometimes it requires a reboot of my 3rd generation iPad. It is a nice looking app as you would want it on the iPad, it has only one stability problem.",PD
"I called HP to reset the printer, iPad and computer, and even they couldn't figure out what the problem was. After a ton of lost time, I decided to delete the app, and it enabled the iPad to find the printer with AirPrint.

"The only good thing about the last update is the ability to create folders, but you can't create folders within folders. I wish you could. The bad thing about the last update? Now typing has a delay that's very annoying. I don't understand how that happened because there's no crazy graphical user interface or anything animated. The most important thing that's pretty good for most people is removing the TAB key. I always hated that the TAB key was at the top of the ruler. I'd prefer to have just a shift key and place the TAB on the keyboard, but now I wish it was at the top. Now you have to go through a complicated process and menu to use it.

"I give the NFL '12 v3 update three stars, largely because it's an improvement over the previous version, the in-game display is better organized, and the ""scores"" page is far superior to the previous version in many ways: you can now see all the games of the current week on one screen instead of scrolling through a list. After a modest period of use, the app appears much more stable, but in many ways it still needs to work. The scoring summary is gone (as far as I can tell); I often found this helpful when watching games that I don't follow from game to game. ""Team leaders"" seem to be limited to only one QB (passed), 1 player rushes, and 2 receivers, with no obvious ability to scroll through players or draw a full listing. Especially during preseason games when teams are running through multiple personnel packages, this is very frustrating - there is no way (for example) to compare the passing stats of the 2 or 3 QBs if I have a bigger problem on Thursday, which is not a major one for Dalati.",PD

"Places on maps are incredibly inaccurate Sometimes it's just a few blocks wrong, or maybe a mislabeled street, but I see much worse places outside of San Miguel de Allende within downtown. Do you want to play golf? Come to the Historic Centro, where it's mapped but doesn't exist. The funniest accuracy is the pyramid, which is said to be a few blocks from my rental home. The related problem is the ""Near Me"" feature. Initially, the app couldn't find me. Instead, it thought I was in a city in two hours and showed me sights for that city. As I dragged the map into the city I'm in was more map craziness, but worse. The few places that were accurately mapped were now moved within a block or two of my house. Finally, the new version is less functional than the previous version. And it's much less functional than the site Bottom line, as I delete, at least until this version is resolved, I'm definitely having map problems.",PD

"The notes, bullet points, spacing, and numbering all fail when I transfer them to Word and other systems, resulting in formatting problems that take longer than just starting over and typing in notes. I also notice that the left column flickers and the program crashes on every other use. Approximately one in four synchronization issues an error message. Apart from that, I like to call up notes on my phone, iPad, and desktop (almost) whenever I want. If this problematic version is to get me to choose another version, it is not the case. If this version were more solid, I would be tempted to buy the upgrade.",PD
I can't open it on my iPad 3 Help! Crash! Crash! Crash! Crash! Crash!,PD

"Okay, Evernote, I hope you're listening, you had a great idea, but ""Note"" shouldn't be in your name Call it Eversomething Text formatting makes it virtually impossible to create a note with any form of rich text, bullets, numbered lists, indentations, etc. Maybe the underlying code base or architecture makes it difficult to create rich text with proper formatting, I don't know, but until this is fixed, it's not useful And man, I've really tried to like Evernote Synchronization capability across so many platforms has been great, but I need to go back to OneNote now Who knows if you're reading this But I really wish you would understand this tremendous weakness in your product And I've googled a lot to know that I'm not the only one who wants better text functionality Please fix I really want a real Evernote!",PD

"In an earlier version, when the user viewed images and suspended the app, he would leave them where they were when the app restarted. Now, the app is completely refreshed on startup, which can be annoying at times. Also, swiping through the images is more cumbersome, as it only responds to the top half of the screen, rather than the entire screen.",PD
"It used to be my most used app, but now it's a problem to find hotels when I'm looking for a geographical location. I now have to enter numerous cities and do numerous searches to find what I'm looking for.",PD
"This is not a review of the Dropbox service (which is great), but of this app, which can use many improvements. Most frustrating of all is that it only displays about a dozen characters in a filename. As I have thousands of files, some of which have long and descriptive names, it is impossible to find what I am looking for, unless I download the files one at a time to the iPad. There is no way to shrink the file list to make more of the files visible. Why not?",PD
"WtfI was happy to pin away when I got an msg telling me that I had reached my pin limit Wtf? Look, if we're going to have limits on what I can pin then I'm going to delete this app and my account That's just stupid Plz fix I love Pinterest but if I can't get the same quality of service I used to, what's the point?",PD

"It may sound like a broken record, but I really like your app when it can be downloaded, but it can't now. I hate having to type that, but it needs to be fixed.",PD
"The offline option always worked great. Don't expect this map to tell you distances from place to place, it won't work, but once you're in a city, if you want to get around, it's hard to beat.",PD
"It used to be a good application with the ability to search and filter for reviews and proximity in cities you have not yet reached, but these features have been replaced by features that focus on marketing hotel concentrations. Do not use this application to buy a good travel guide instead.",PD
"Update, the performance of EN has improved considerably since my last review (from 2 to 3 stars), but the app remains pretty flawed. It constantly reports synchronization errors, freezes for a moment between all actions, crashes here and there, and the search function sometimes doesn't find keywords. I'm borderline and thinking about going premium, but also have an eye for alternatives. Note: Some of my problems might be related to some incompatibility of iPad2 with iOS7Previous review. After several months of daily use and building up about 1K of pretty intense notes, I was about to make a serious long-term commitment to EN - but I had to seriously reconsider this after the problems with the latest upgrade. The problems I experienced are not as severe as what others report, mine were mostly with the iPad 2 version, while the desktop version w MacBook Air continues to work.",PD
"Older versions of this app allowed me to preview Word, Excel and pdf documents while the preview window was still in place. It only tells me the file name and size and does NOT show the contents in a completely useless way.",PD
Cannot simply split the composition due to the file type.,PD
"First of all, let me say that it looks great... if I could manage to get up for more than 5 seconds... then HOLD it! The concept is wonderful and the app seems to be beautifully made from the point of view of the user interface, but it is very unstable. Big disappointment as I use this for my doctoral thesis, big failure in the categories of mobility and comfort... 0 out of 10 for usefulness.",PD
New update gives no details about changes Now the app no longer works Just a black screen with a gray bar at the bottom,PD
The user interface works great and the mapping is nice:) The only bug I've seen is sometimes the Facebook integration.,PD

I like the fact that I can download drop boxes on any device and share images What I don't like is the time it takes to download images and that I always need to be connected to the internet to download them. This keeps the images from downloading a few times when I'm away from Wifi 2613. I'm still trying to find out if images that support the app aren't downloaded and I'll remove this app from my iPad because it's worthless.,PD
"This once great app is now useless, every address I type fails. I was a loyal and constant user before the update, now I'm looking for another app that actually works.",PD
"The forecast is no more specific than a high and low temperature and a picture of the weather for the whole day. Nevertheless, this should not be too detailed, and it offers a lot of information for the current time. My biggest complaint is that the app often crashes at startup. Sometimes it is loaded the second time, sometimes it requires a reboot of my 3rd generation iPad. It is a nice looking app as you would want it on the iPad, it has only one stability problem.",PD
"I called HP to reset the printer, iPad and computer, and even they couldn't figure out what the problem was. After a ton of lost time, I decided to delete the app, and it enabled the iPad to find the printer with AirPrint.

"The only good thing about the last update is the ability to create folders, but you can't create folders within folders. I wish you could. The bad thing about the last update? Now typing has a delay that's very annoying. I don't understand how that happened because there's no crazy graphical user interface or anything animated. The most important thing that's pretty good for most people is removing the TAB key. I always hated that the TAB key was at the top of the ruler. I'd prefer to have just a shift key and place the TAB on the keyboard, but now I wish it was at the top. Now you have to go through a complicated process and menu to use it.

However, there is still a problem that is that when you try to use the ""Open in"" option in other iPad applications and prompt Dropbox to open, the just opened file appears in the iPad Dropbox application, but the Dropbox server is not updated, which means that the file is not found in the Dropbox folders when you access the folders from another computer, etc.",PD

"I give the NFL '12 v3 update three stars, largely because it's an improvement over the previous version, the in-game display is better organized, and the ""scores"" page is far superior to the previous version in many ways: you can now see all the games of the current week on one screen instead of scrolling through a list. After a modest period of use, the app appears much more stable, but in many ways it still needs to work. The scoring summary is gone (as far as I can tell); I often found this helpful when watching games that I don't follow from game to game. ""Team leaders"" seem to be limited to only one QB (passed), 1 player rushes, and 2 receivers, with no obvious ability to scroll through players or draw a full listing. Especially during preseason games when teams are running through multiple personnel packages, this is very frustrating - there is no way (for example) to compare the passing stats of the 2 or 3 QBs if I have a bigger problem on Thursday, which is not a major one for Dalati.",PD

Once I finally got the right game, it's very pretty with smooth graphics, a fantastic soundtrack and some of the best scenes I've ever seen on my tablet.
