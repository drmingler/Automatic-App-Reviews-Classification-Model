Clearly showing your greed, Rovio. Cut it back by 80000 notches. I have started to avoid any app that offers iAP purchases. Not that I don't appreciate the addition of powerups, but if you want more money, don't include iAP purchases, raise the price of your game! If it's a good game, people will buy it no matter the cost. Take this advice, Rovio. People will be more inclined to support you if you're not milking every dime you can out of them.",Angrybirds

Not that the current stuff that sounds like some Tetris and bohemian styles are mixed in is bad. It just sounds like some of the classic users can no longer have the classic experience they love. Also, from the psychological side, you guys did a brilliant job of taunting us with your piggies to keep playing one more round. There are probably many who don't like the new levels, and have lost there sense of completion (three stars and all.) that's my feedback. Angry Birds is a *classic*.

Apparently product management at Rovio decided that it would be a good idea to completely change everything about the game that has made it a global smash global hit. There's only one bird, it doesn't behave like any of the other birds in any of the other levels or games, and gameplay is overall tedious and frustrating. Starting with the slow ramp-up of every level where you have to wait a painful amount of time for the piggies to approach the slingshot to the moving targets and poor aiming abilities of the bird... it's all just a big mess.Hint: It might be a good idea to perform actual user testing with real-life customers before changing the core value proposition and nature of the world's most successful multitouch game.",Angrybirds

But it has a few things that could be easily improved. 1) Even on an iPad in landscape mode, Dropbox only allows about 2"" of the screen for the file browser, meaning many filenames get dramatically abbreviated, so that I cannot tell which file I want. This is annoying, because I generally want to find a file, then view it, not both at the same time. 2) It is not obvious that you can store files locally by marking them with a star. I also cannot find a way to do this without opening the file first.  In my case, I want to transfer a few files on to my iPad for offline reading, and don't really want to open each file.",Dropbox

I've been using Dropbox for years for school work and it's saved me plenty of times when I forgot to pick up my papers from my printer. I really wish you could improve the music player though. I was running out of space on my iPad so I had to delete all my music. I was hoping to use Dropbox or an app that plays music off of Dropbox but none of those work. The music player right now isn't best. It doesn't have loop, loop one, shuffle, etc. It also takes a lot of time to load each song before they actually play. If you do consider improving the player, also think about how some people organize their music in a folder called Music and sub folders by artists and albums. Perhaps make an option to only play certain folders and/or play all sub folders.",Dropbox

I love the security of storing my most important documents online and the ability to access my content on all my devices. As far as the app goes, however, there are a few bugs that need to be worked out and some features that ought to be added. 1. The app will often time fail to open a document and needs to be restarted before it will load. It will sometimes even freeze and crash. 2. In order to open your files on a mobile device, you have to be connected to the internet. You can mark the files you choose as favorites and they can be viewed offline. But you have to mark every file individually, which is impractical because I have thousands of files in folders and subfolders. This wouldn't be so bad if the app let you make a FOLDER a favorite and all files it contained would automatically be saved onto the device for offline viewing. But such a simple feature is not present. There ought to be an option to have all documents saved on the device and updated via Internet connection (like the computer version). This would especially be good for people who use a mobile device as their primary device; all your content would be immediately available. 3. If you want to reorganize your files or move documents, you have to do each one individually. Why can't I select multiple documents and move them together to another location? Once again, a simple feature to add. 4. There is no option to rename a file or folder, which is an incredible nuisance.Everybody ought to have this app. It is fantastic. However, there is significant room for improvement. Nonetheless I would recommend Dropbox hands down over and against any of its competitors. In terms of functionality and easy of use, there really is no competition.",Dropbox

But it's a slow process, so I close the app.  The app keeps uploading my photos for approx 5 minutes or so, then it stops!  So I have to keep opening the app over and over, or try to keep the app open for an hour or so (but the phone locks after a few minutes, and then the app closes.)  It just doesn't work well in a practical setting.  It's a good a good idea, it just needs some tweaking.  I'd love if the pictures would upload automatically, w/o me even having to open the app, and continue uploading whether the app is open or closed.",Dropbox

After which you will tell them that you still need help and they will respond by saying they have closed your ticket because you're asking about an issue they don't want to admit they're having, such as the faulty programming I mentioned above.

Ugh!!! So I will end up clicking on the result, just to see if the address matches, and then hit the Back button to click another Starbucks hoping to hit the jackpot and see if that has the address I want. Sorry, but Yelp makes looking for the listing easier, showing the address upfront to help you choose if it's the right one.3) And so, if I can't still find it, I will end up using Google and typing the name, address and the word, trip advisor.

Instead, it thought I was in a town two hours away and showed me attractions for that town. When I dragged the map to the town I am in there was more of the map craziness, but even worse.

3534,141656,RT,None,5,2,"Good potential I like the chance to read reviews by people who recently traveled to all sorts of places, including less popular destinations like Anguilla and Bonaire.  There is room for improvement, though.  It is hard to keep your searches confined to your location.  For example, I'm in Anguilla, and search for Bonjour Cafe and get someplace in New Zealand.  Also, when I look at the reviews, not all restaurants have information about the hours or price range, yet when I write a review, I don't have the option of providing that information.

Allow for searching by map area, so you can scan what's in an area you are walking towards, not just where you are that second.3.  When dropping a pin on a map to show where something is the app also  needs to also show the blue dot for where you are.  Navigation is a bit difficult in an unfamiliar city if I can't see where I am in relation to where I want to go.  4.  Directions should be given via google maps rather than Apple maps.

But, their apps are very frustrating to use. Complaint No. 1: There seems to be no way to access reviews that a user has previously written as there is with their website. Complaint No. 2: When searching for establishments, specifically restaurants, the results are presented in a confusing manner. For example, I searched for restaurants in Vienna, Austria and clicked Find Restaurants. What was returned was a list of restaurants, in order of popularity, with numbers 1, 4, 5, and 7 etc. missing, i.e., numbers 2, 3, 6, 8 etc. were displayed. What is going on here? Why are not all of the restaurants in Vienna listed in order according to their ranking when that is what was requested? I think the answer is that the restaurants displayed are linked to the map that is also displayed with the results. This makes no sense because the search criteria were restaurants in Vienna and not restaurants in Vienna that happen to be in the map that is displayed with the results. This bug should be fixed. Furthermore, after search results are displayed, if one zooms in with the map, then the search results in the list are changed to the ones on the newly zoomed map and the locations of the restaurants on the map are also re-lettered. This kind of chaos can be very frustrating because each time one zooms the map its as if everything is rearranged. My last general issue with the apps is that they seem hotel-oriented and some of the features direct you to hotels when users could just as often look to tripadvisor for restaurant information.
